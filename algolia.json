[{"content":" Introduction to the Survey Solutions .NET API Client package There is a client library aviable to be used in .NET runtime to execute API methods of Survey Solutions software. In order to get started install dotnet SDK. After done that you will be able to use included in SDK CLI to create a new project, execute the following command: dotnet new console This will create a sample console application. To add Survey solutions client library execute following command: dotnet add package SurveySolutionsClient Now open Program.cs file and replace contents with the following: using System; using System.Net.Http; using System.Threading.Tasks; using SurveySolutionsClient; using SurveySolutionsClient.Apis; using SurveySolutionsClient.Models; namespace sample { class Program { static async Task Main(string[] args) { // API user login and password.

The following are the rules guiding the use and functioning of the workspaces: An administrator has access to all workspaces. A user with an HQ and observer accounts may belong to one, some, or all workspaces, as designated by the administrator. Each interviewer and supervisor account may log in to a single workspace. User names are unique across all workspaces. Questionnaires are imported into workspaces. Same questionnaire may be imported into different workspaces if necessary and their version numbering is independent. Workspaces may be created, disabled, and deleted. Disabling a workspace locks all activity in the workspace (stops web interviews, does not allow any user to log in). Users attempting to access a disabled workspace will receive a \u0026ldquo;Workspace Disabled\u0026rdquo; error page and must contact their survey coordinator for further instructions. A workspace may be deleted only if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any surveys/questionnaires. Deleting a workspace actually deletes (not archives) all the user accounts (interviewer/ supervisor) and all the maps that were part of that workspace. Deletion of a workspace is irreversible. Administrator configures each workspace settings separately (logo, global message, export password, email providers, etc). The troubleshooting tools available for administrator (audit log, device logs, tablet information packages, etc) are separated by workspaces. Users having access to multiple workspaces may switch between them using a workspace selector without the need to log in to each workspace separately. Reports are built based on the content of a single workspace. A special workspace named \u0026lsquo;primary\u0026rsquo; is always defined and can not be disabled or deleted. Any server updated from earlier Survey Solutions versions will place all the earlier entered data (including survey data, user accounts, maps, etc) into the primary workspace. An observer may observe only in the workspaces in which he is permitted by the administrator, even if impersonating users that have access to other workspaces. Each workspace is assigned an identifier and a text label. The text label is shown to the users when they switch between the workspaces, while the identifier is used for forming the URLs in API calls. To manage workspaces, the menu item server administration (available for administrators only) now leads to the list of the workspaces defined on the server. The settings and troubleshooting tools collected in the context menu were previously relevant for the whole server, but now are attributable to a particular workspace. For each enabled workspace the following actions are provided in the workspace context menu: Edit, Settings, Email providers, Device logs, Audit log, Tablet information packages, Disable* Delete* *) The actions to disable and delete a workspace do not apply to the primary workspace. Disabled workspaces may only be turned back on or deleted, so their context menu is smaller: Enable Delete List of users on the server Users on the server are distinguished by the accounts and the full list of all accounts on the server is available by accessing the Server administration \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Users Management page. The list supports filtering by workspace and role of the user, as well as narrowing down the users to a particular group: \u0026lsquo;missing workspaces\u0026rsquo; - users not assigned to any workspace. \u0026lsquo;with disabled workspaces only\u0026rsquo; - users that don\u0026rsquo;t have access to any enabled workspace. \u0026lsquo;locked users\u0026rsquo; - users with an account lock placed on them. \u0026lsquo;archived users\u0026rsquo; - users that have been archived. A search box allows to seek the list for a user with a particular account name or a full name. Adding users to workspaces Some users (Headquarters, API users) may be granted access to more than 1 workspace. This access is granted by the server administrator at the Server Administration \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; User Management page. To give access to a certain workspace, the administrator selects the user account(s) from the list of all user accounts on the server, then selects Add to Workspaces. In the dialog window that appear, administrator should select the names of the workspaces that the user should be granted access to, and confirm the changes. As a result, the selected users are granted access to the workspaces, which are selected in the dialog. Any other workspaces that they had access to previously will be still accessible. To remove access to a certain workspace, the administrator selects the user account(s) from the list of all user accounts on the server, then selects Remove from Workspaces. In the dialog window that appear, administrator should select the names of the workspaces that the user should be eliminated from, and confirm the changes. As a result, the selected users are denied access to the workspaces, which are selected in the dialog. Any other workspaces that they had access to previously will be still accessible. Alternatively, for a single user the administrator can access the account profile in the server and select the workspaces tab. The checkmarks in this dialog indicate the workspaces that the selected user currently has access to. The administrator can add or remove access to any workspaces by adding and removing the appropriate checkboxes. Any such changes are applied immediately on pressing the Update button.","keywords":["workspace","partition","isolate"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"March 1, 2021","objectID":"0135bdfde187a2a53c3e2afbce9c418f","section":"Headquarters","title":"Workspaces","type":"headquarters","url":"/headquarters/accounts/workspaces/","wordcount":856},{"content":" Use the instructions below to diagnose tablets' performance issues, which can manifest themselves as: slowness (occasional or permanent) while working with the Interviewer App; freezes for a considerable period of time; crashes and restarts of the application; or a combination of the above. NB: For troubleshooting the synchronization errors, refer to the synchronization problems article. Check that the tablet is not in the low-power mode. If in the low-power mode, change to normal mode and retry (some tablets may need to restart, or sleep and wake up for the mode switch to become effective). Check that the tablets are using an up-to-date version of Survey Solutions and update if necessary. (versions are important for troubleshooting and we need to know that the newest version is still affected, or else this is the solution.). Confirm the latest version is used. Check whether there is a similar case reported in the users’ forum. If yes, indicate which thread/threads are mentioning the same symptoms. Check whether the issue occurs on a new tablet that is not part of the interviewers' stock. Interviewers are people and can do many bad things to the tablets intentionally or unintentionally, so we need to exclude this factor. Use a factory reset if there is no other tablet to try. (any unsynchronized data will be lost as a result of the factory reset or uninstall). Clearly report the tablet brand, model, model number if the issue persists. Check whether the problem occurs on all, some or one tablet only. Describe in detail: what is common between the tablets in \u0026lsquo;working\u0026rsquo; group, and similarly what is common for the tablets in the \u0026lsquo;non-working group\u0026rsquo;, and what is different between the \u0026lsquo;working\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;non-working\u0026rsquo; groups. For example: \u0026ldquo;the issue occurs with Survey Solutions v24.09 on all Samsung SMT-9399 tablets running Android 12.7 and doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur on Samsung SMT-9897 tablets running Android 12.7 nor in Dell PowerTab-3000 running Android 18.0. The characteristics of these devices are as follows (indicate memory, storage, available storage, CPU type)\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; refer to the diagnostics dialog to obtain the descriptive information of the tablet and Interviewer App. Check whether there were any OS-updates (or third party software updates) installed recently on the tablets in the \u0026lsquo;non-working\u0026rsquo; group. Clearly state what version and update of the Android OS is set up on the affected device(s). Have a security check (antivirus, antimalware) of the affected tablets, especially when there is no systematic difference between the \u0026lsquo;working\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;non-working\u0026rsquo; groups in hardware characteristics or OS version and configuration. Check tablets for presence of any other applications that may be competing for the resources with the Interviewer App (social networks, games, messengers, unknown applications). Uninstall everything that is not needed for the normal work of an interviewer. Try a different questionnaire: create a simple questionnaire of a handful of questions and see if the issue occurs there too. Exercise your judgement as to how big this should be and what questions to include. When in doubt use 10 questions of different types or model the section of your actual questionnaire where the slowness appears. For a quick check use a public questionnaire \u0026lsquo;ServiceB2\u0026rsquo; from the \u0026lsquo;Service and maintenance\u0026rsquo; folder. If the benchmark questionnaire is responsive the problem is likely related to your particular questionnaire. If not responsive, then this benchmark questionnaire can be used in all subsequent steps/tests. If the benchmark/example questionnaire does not exhibit the issue, start reducing your questionnaire by cutting off some of the pieces of it (work on a copy, of course). Delete sections, individual questions or their conditions. And periodically retest the questionnaire. Once it becomes responsive again, review the recent deletions to identify which one has caused the performance to improve. Note that the size of a syntax condition (in characters or lines) is not necessarily a good predictor for the time that will be needed to execute it. Even a one-liner can freeze a powerful computer with a slow loop-like code structure. Slowness may occur due to entirely not obvious things, such as usage of text substitutions in questions, not related to syntax at all. The issue may be data related: the checks in a 20-person household are going to be slower than in a 10-person household, and much slower than in a 1-person household. See whether the issue is sensitive to the amount of data being preloaded by varying the input data volume. Include your findings in your report. Use the Tester App to measure the actual response time in milliseconds. If the issue occurs only in some sections/rosters/etc which is not immediately obvious, include instructions on what input must be entered (which values and in which sequence). If the slowness is observed in an up-to-date version of Survey Solutions Interviewer/Tester with a benchmark questionnaire this could very well be its actual performance. Explain why the observed values are considered by you as \u0026lsquo;abnormal/slow\u0026rsquo;.

Isolation of work into workspaces This feature is the response of the Survey Solutions developers team to frequent requests of the users to separate different data collection operations to limit access to data for the users that manage the surveys. This is common for organizations that conduct multiple operations, often in several locations or countries, cooperate with different partners and/or have to outsource work to different subcontractors. Recall that the HQ-users have access to all the data that is collected as part of any survey that is being conducted on the server. This gives any HQ-user to intervene in any survey by making new assignments, or making approval/rejection decisions, and importantly, exporting/downloading the data. Until now the only way of making the isolation was to instantiate multiple Survey Solutions data servers, which was costly and required multiple administrator accounts to coordinate the work of multiple servers. Over the last year we have had extensive discussions with users setting up their servers and facing the above problem. As a result, we are introducing a new concept of a workspace into the Survey Solutions, which, we hope, will help in this regard. Workspaces allow partitioning of a single server into multiple compartments that have limited impact on each other. The following are the rules guiding the use and functioning of the workspaces: An administrator has access to all workspaces. A user with an HQ and observer accounts may belong to one, some, or all workspaces, as designated by the administrator. Each interviewer and supervisor account may log in to a single workspace. User names are unique across all workspaces. Questionnaires are imported into workspaces. Same questionnaire may be imported into different workspaces if necessary and their version numbering is independent. Workspaces may be created, disabled, and deleted.

Disabled workspaces may only be turned back on or deleted, so their context menu is smaller: Enable Delete The workspaces is a major change to the earlier established hierarchies and rules, and we continue to build functionality around this new concept. We have attempted to make as smooth as possible transition for our existing users, and hope you will make good use of this new capability. Server-wide users management page for administrator Since the account names are unique on the server, the admin needs a consolidated view of all user accounts, regardless in which workspace they are defined. This is implemented in the Users Management menu of the server administration view. For each user account defined in the server the following information is listed: account name (login) role workspace(s) full name email phone number A padlock icon located next to the user account indicates that this account has been locked (e.g. an interviewer account locked by his supervisor). The filters in the left side of the page allow to concentrate only on users with particular attributes: locked, archived, ones without assigned workspaces, or being placed in disabled workspaces. In this list the administrator may access the profile of every individual user (except archived ones) to correct the contact information, reset the password or grant access to workspaces for HQ-users, observers, and API accounts. Map dashboard for online users. The new map dashboard feature introduced in Survey Solutions v21.01 is a tool for a graphical presentation of the worklist on a map and provides functionality similar to the tablet map dashboard added in v20.07 to the Interviewer App. It is accessible to interviewers through the menu item Map Dashboard and for managers (supervisors/HQ-users/Admins) via a map icon at the pages showing assignments or interviews. The map dashboard is not to be confused with the earlier available map report.

Calendar events. Alert interviewers of wrong clock settings. Variables on dashboard. Filter by status in survey statistics report. Calendar events Calendar events is a new feature of Survey Solutions, which allows the interviewer to assign a calendar event to a certain assignment or an interview. This is useful if the interview can\u0026rsquo;t be completed on the spot and requires scheduling for another visit. The calendar event consists of a date, time and an optional message. The entered information will be shown on the interview/assignment card after the \u0026lsquo;next contact\u0026rsquo; prompt: The event marker is automatically shown in red color if it is in the past. The interviewer may adjust the calendar event\u0026rsquo;s properties (date, time, comment) or delete it. During the synchronization the information on the calendar events is also sent to the server. If the interviewer logs in to the web interface, he/she will find the left reminders attached to assignments there. The headquarters/supervisors will be able to find the information about the calendar events in the grids showing the lists of assignments and interviews, as well as in the detailed view of the assignment properties. The same information is available through API queries to help automated systems that may reflect this information in the form of calendars or schedules. Alert interviewers of wrong clock settings Complete discharge of a tablet may lead to reset of the built-in clock to some default value, such as the date of manufacturing of the tablet, or date of the compilation of the Android OS, or another constant, for example January 01, 2011. If the interviewer continues operation with a wrong clock setting, this will corrupt timestamps of answers and make paradata unusable. Most tablets/phones would automatically adjust the clock settings when connecting to mobile or Wi-Fi networks. Yet, if the device is working disconnected there is usually no opportunity for such automatic clock correction. The new version will automatically notify the interviewer if it detects the clock setting is obviously wrong indicating time earlier than known actual time. The message serves as a warning, but it is recommended that the interviewers immediately check their clock and time zone settings. Variables on dashboard Values of variables calculated in the interview will now appear at the dashboard (or card view for tablet-based interviewer) if they are placed into the cover section by the questionnaire designer. Variable label (must be specified for all elements of a cover section) is used as an explanatory text. For example, this feature is useful if we want to automatically determine and show the name of the household head or his/her contact phone number at the dashboard. Note that the variables are calculated for interviews only (not calculated for any assignments). Filter by status in survey statistics report. Survey statistics report is useful for quick diagnostics and checks during the survey collection, yet these reports may be contaminated by information from interviews that are not completed, or completed, but not approved yet. The new filter allows to concentrate the report, for example, only on the interviews approved by the supervisor.","keywords":["20.12"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"December 14, 2020","objectID":"b2f989e575d9c9b2a409f50005bbc196","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 20.12","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-20-12/","wordcount":517},{"content":" Survey Solutions server administrator has access to the special healthcheck page using the following: menu → Administration → Diagnostics.

Editor of reusable categories in Designer Reusable categories editor allows defining new and editing existing reusable categories in the interface of the Designer tool, without first defining an external file, which was the case earlier. Generation of cover page Questionnaires designed in the Designer tool before July 20, 2020 are editable in the compatibility mode that retains identifying questions in their positions and presenting a \u0026lsquo;Virtual Cover Page\u0026rsquo; aggregating all identifying questions into a single read-only section. To take advantage of the new capabilities of the real cover page section, the actual cover page section needs to be generated, which the questionnaire author can do by clicking the corresponding link: This is an irreversible process. Only update the questionnaire if you know it will not be used with Survey Solutions Headquarters earlier than v20.07. Linked combobox single-select questions A new flavor of the single select question has been added: linked combobox. This question is useful if one needs to select from a list of the values specific to the interview (either preloaded in advance or collected in the same interview). Text formatting for web-interviewing pages Web-interviews involve a number of pages on the server: welcome page, resume page, and finish page, where the survey coordinator may provide custom text. The new feature permits markdown formatting to be used for text decoration in these pages. Notably, besides text decoration, users can now insert images into the content of these pages. Approve rejected interviews Earlier versions required an interviewer action if the supervisor has changed his/her mind and now wants to approve the interview already rejected ( completion action by the interviewer). New version allows the supervisor to approve such rejected interviews without awaiting for the interviewer action. Note however, that this action should be taken with caution. If the interviewer has already received the rejected interview on the tablet, any changes to that interview will be lost, if the interview is subsequently approved by the supervisor before the changed completed interview is received on the server. (technically the interview will be stored in the \u0026lsquo;broken packages\u0026rsquo;). Interview resume event indicates where the interview was resumed This is important for mixed-mode surveys, which involve work on interview on tablets and using web. Paradata files exported from this version onwards will contain a mode specification for each \u0026lsquo;Resumed\u0026rsquo; event. The value can be either of the following specific and non-localizable strings: Web Tablet Unknown Where the value \u0026ldquo;Tablet\u0026rdquo; denotes the session was resumed on a tablet, value \u0026ldquo;Web\u0026rdquo; denotes the session was resumed on the server via a web-connection (either by a Web-interviewer or by a respondent to a web interview). The value \u0026ldquo;Unknown\u0026rdquo; is utilized for compatibility and is present for events recorded before the upgrade to this new version. Send email confirmation with answers to web-interview respondents Participants in web surveys may now receive a confirmation email from the survey organizers - two new checkboxes are added to the configuration of web interviews: \u0026ldquo;Send email after web interview completion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Attach PDF transcript.\u0026rdquo; This is useful if it is important for the respondents to retain a transcript of their answers to the survey. Public API now allows protection of questions Property \u0026ldquo;ProtectedVariables\u0026rdquo; has been added to the API query generating new assignments on the server, which may contain an array of variable names to be protected. Protection of answers is not the same as \u0026lsquo;read-only\u0026rsquo;. Read more here. Improved speed for survey deletion and assignments upgrade. Several clients collecting surveys with more than 1mln interviews have experienced that some operations take abnormally large time. The procedures for deleting the survey and upgrading assignments have been performance-optimized and as a result the new version performs these operations much faster. Updated translations to Spanish Translation of Survey Solutions to Spanish has been updated, thanks to Vladimir Aguiñada, who has contributed the updated Spanish text. Fixed geography type question to work on Android 10.0 The code responsible for the geography type questions was not working correctly on tablets with Android version 10.0. This incompatibility has been fixed now.","keywords":["20.10"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"November 7, 2020","objectID":"5dd83b4d378e47a99046e8c469505070","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 20.10","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-20-10/","wordcount":747},{"content":" Installation of Survey Solutions on Microsoft Azure In order to install - register on azure portal and login.

To do it find resource group you created in the beginning and find AppSvc-SurveySolutions-plan in the list (or name you gave to service plan). Here you can change available resources for Survey Solutions. On the overview tab you can see how much resources is consumed right now, so you can decide if its enough or not. If you encreased app service plan resources but system still works slowly check if database instance keeps up with load. In same resources group find suso-postgres resource. On the overview tab you see resource utilization graph. See if current tier is enough for your load and scale up/down accordingly. Warning: Please note that changing to and from the Basic compute tier or changing the backup redundancy options after server creation is not supported for PostgreSQL database.

A particular survey may come up with a numbering like 2 digits of the province code, followed by 3 digits of the district code, followed by the household id of 4 digits. Yet it is not a good identifier in the case where several surveys are conducted on the same server, or there may be repetitive visits, and other twists. Survey Solutions protects the integrity of the data by not trusting the user to make the decisions where the integrity of data may be put at risk due to careless design. For that the program relies on a concept known as GUID (see more details in Wikipedia). A GUID is assigned to any interview conducted with Survey Solutions. And: such assignment is automatic - there is nothing that the designer or the administrator of the survey needs to do specially to make it happen. such assignment is automatic - there is nothing that the designer or the administrator of the survey may do to prevent it from happening. the assigned GUIDs are invisible to the interviewers and respondents: they never need to enter them or even know of their existence. Example: In a survey of cars crossing the bridge you record (in a separate interview) for each car the following information: car type (passenger, lorry, bus, etc) and color (red/green/blue/etc). The data may come out from Survey Solutions as: interview__idcar_typecar_color******** 4f53769053864f638d4d4a962fcbabd3busyellow* 31ba4bb9b5414458a6886efd695d12d1passengerred* 12a369339a5748b994801df21ea20ba2truckblue* e4710251a7974b3ca28e12a7424c1519buswhite* 61fcce6fa8fd4d2c8aa57eeaf0b8ec55passengerwhite* The last column covered with asterisks indicates that there are also other automatically generated attributes of records, which are not relevant for this discussion. The interview__id is a unique identifier. It is assigned to the whole interview when it is created in an unpredictable (chaotic, random) pattern and stays invariable through the existence of that interview. If for any reason, such as publishing this dataset I needed a simpler looking car__id, once the data collection is completed I could generate it with the following Stata code: generate long car__id = _n Note that the exported records are not guaranteed to be in any order. Do not assume that they are e.g. chronological. Example 2: In a household survey you collect (in a separate interview) for every household the household size, and for every household member their age and sex. The data will come out of Survey Solutions in 2 files (in fact more, but other files are system-generated diagnostics and other information not relevant for this description). The household level (interview level, or main) file will have the following layout: interview__idhhsize******** 4f53769053864f638d4d4a962fcbabd32* 31ba4bb9b5414458a6886efd695d12d11* 12a369339a5748b994801df21ea20ba23* e4710251a7974b3ca28e12a7424c15192* 61fcce6fa8fd4d2c8aa57eeaf0b8ec551* The individual level data will come out as: interview__idperson__idagesex******** e0c9d430a89241fb9078f81d738f112e143male* e0c9d430a89241fb9078f81d738f112e239female* 1cda4e243e76402e9bff0300fa93eaee144male* de18f59a31344c52a8bc3edd44098f02152male* de18f59a31344c52a8bc3edd44098f02250female* de18f59a31344c52a8bc3edd44098f02312male* 41e3db71db7e4041a097850d517278e9119female* 41e3db71db7e4041a097850d517278e921female* 93dda6f6add94a789fa24f5416a0865d169male* Note that there are duplicate values in each of the columns: interview__id and person__id. But there are never any duplicates in both columns at the same time. Thus interview__id and person__id is a joint identifier (aka compound key). One can always create a single key from a compound key by writing together all the components, taking into account the width in digits. Such as in the above example the ID of the first person could be \u0026ldquo;e0c9d430a89241fb9078f81d738f112e1\u0026rdquo;. In practice we would first renumber the households, such as \u0026ldquo;e0c9d430a89241fb9078f81d738f112e\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;1cda4e243e76402e9bff0300fa93eaee\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo;, and only then perform concatenation. Note that the interview__id is not an increasing value. Newer IDs may be assigned from in between the already assigned, hence one can’t be using sorting of the GUIDs to renumber them in two different export files and obtain consistent renumbering. The described mechanism of identification automatically extends to deeper levels of data in case of nested rosters. Up to 4 IDs corresponding to roster levels may be assigned, such as in cases of: Building → household → person; Household → plot → crop → crop disposition; Company → department → employee; Shop → isle → item, etc Since the GUID is automatically generated and always utilized for establishing the links between different data levels, effectively the survey questionnaire doesn’t have to define any identifying questions (such as province, district, etc) for this purpose. Survey Solutions will automatically utilize the interview ID for this purpose instead. (Yet those fields are useful for locating the targeted household, hence a dedicated \u0026ldquo;Cover page\u0026rdquo; section is automatically added to every questionnaire). Note also that the exact numbering of the persons in this example (and correspondingly other units in other surveys) may depend on what triggers the size of the roster. Gaps are possible in these IDs if the trigger question is e.g. a multiselect question (for the ID in that case is the code of only selected options), or a fixed roster (if the original numeration was not consecutive), or a text-list question (if deletions occurred from the beginning or the middle of the list). For any roster, the gaps in numbering are possible, if enabling conditions were specified to enable the roster records only for some of the units. Example 3: In this example we consider a more complex survey, which happens in several steps: first administrative records for enterprises are consulted to determine the address of the enterprise and indicative number of employees. Then one or more interviewers are sent to the enterprise to conduct interviews with the owner (based on Questionnaire A) about the enterprise and employees (based on Questionnaire B) about their working histories. For small enterprises (\u0026lt;5 employees) only one employee is interviewed, for medium (6-20 employees) two are interviewed, for large (21-100) 5 are interviewed, for 100+ twenty must be interviewed. Correspondingly, after the assignments are made for Questionnaires A and B a link must be established between interviews collected in the two questionnaires. Since these are two different questionnaires, Survey Solutions doesn’t know about the connection between them, unless it is told so. If we knew the interview__id of the enterprise interview, we could have preloaded that as","keywords":["export","interview","identifier","identification"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"October 5, 2020","objectID":"a2399566d3c34d07148147befef1c700","section":"Headquarters","title":"How does Survey Solutions identify records and establish connections between data?","type":"headquarters","url":"/headquarters/export/identify_records/","wordcount":1627},{"content":" a connecting information for the employees survey. But since the interview hasn’t happened yet, we can’t utilize this non-existing ID yet. Luckily, there is a different source of identification available to us, which is assignment__id. This identifier is given to every assignment and correspondingly retained as an automatic attribute in any interview resulting from that assignment. Assignment numbers start with 2 (two). Correspondingly, our sequence of actions would be: Use the administrative information to determine the address of the enterprise. Create an assignment in Survey Solutions based on questionnaire A with address as obtained in #1 above. Preserve the resulting assignment number as G. Use the administrative information to determine the enterprise size category, and corresponding number of personal interviews, denote it as N. Create N assignments in Survey Solutions based on questionnaire B. Mark each with the same addressing information as for the enterprise, a sequential number 1..N and a hidden attribute h_assignment_number equal to G. In practice the above should be implemented as a program/script and not performed manually, to avoid human errors. After the data is collected on the enterprise and the employees, we export data from A and B, and unfold the link in the following manner: for every person in dataset B take her h_assignment_number value. Locate the record in A (main level) where assignment__number == h_assignment_number. There will be exactly one such record. Join the records based on this expression. Note that the same record from A will be utilized for multiple records in B (for there are multiple employees of the same enterprise). If there are multiple surveys going on the same server, the assignment numbers in any particular survey may have gaps in numbering, such as 34, 35, 49, 50, \u0026hellip; Assignment numbers are assigned on the Survey Solutions server chronologically, and thus assignments with larger numbers are more recent. This may be inconvenient for subsequent processing or publication of data. The assignments may be renumbered to eliminate gaps. And in contrast to interview__ids the assignment__ids are strictly increasing. We use the same approach for inter-temporal linking, such as linking 2-nd quarter data with the 1-st quarter data. FAQ 1. Why does not Survey Solutions number the interviews as simply 1,2,\u0026hellip;. ? Because Survey Solutions is a distributed system with semi-autonomous nodes. This means that tablet of interviewer 1 needs to assign numbers to interviews and tablet of interviewer 2 needs to do the same without a possibility of communicating to each other (and with all other tablets) before assigning a new number to an interview. 2. Why does not Survey Solutions number the interviews as username1, username2, username3, etc? This would be incompatible with multi-mode surveys, where the same interviewer may be utilizing a tablet for some interviews and directly accessing the server for others. 3. In a panel survey I forgot to include the quarter (1,2,3,4) among the identifying variables, hence for each household I have 4 assignments with identical identification information. Is this a problem? A proper setup should either include a quarter identifier among the variables as the cover page, or importing the questionnaire 4 times to isolate interviews of each quarter by questionnaire name plus version. Survey Solutions will not confuse the records corresponding to different interviews even if their identification information is exactly the same, because it peeks to the interview__id variable storing a unique GUID to match the records of different levels (such as persons to households). Yet your supervisors will have no obvious guidance on what is different between the 4 interviews, and finding an interview for e.g. the second quarter will be a problem. Should this happen in practice, utilize the paradata, or the system-generated interview__actions file to determine when the interview occurred and hence to which quarter it belongs.","keywords":["export","interview","identifier","identification"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"October 5, 2020","objectID":"a2399566d3c34d07148147befef1c700","section":"Headquarters","title":"How does Survey Solutions identify records and establish connections between data?","type":"headquarters","url":"/headquarters/export/identify_records/","wordcount":1627},{"content":" Survey Solutions export file is a zip-archive with multiple data files corresponding to various levels of data and system-generated accompanying data reflecting the comments, errors, statuses and other technical information about interviews and assignments.

A transcript of the interview showing all questions, answers and timestamps when the answer was given can be now produced for any interview. The transcript is available: for the supervisors and headquarters users from the interview review page, and for the respondents at completion of the interview. The transcript of an interview can be used to: present the content of the interview to a consumer outside of the Survey Solutions system, such as for archival preservation; sending (through a different system) to the respondent as a confirmation of the answers registered in the interview; download an interview as a PDF and review it offline in a situation where supervisors don’t have reliable internet connection. Shapefile can be overlaid onto the map dashboard. A new button has been added to the map dashboard. It allows overlaying a shapefile on top of the basemap. A single shapefile may be placed on the tablet in the following folder: \\TheWorldBank\\Shared\\ShapeFileCache It is the same shapefile that is used in the map dashboard and in the geography questions. The shapefile may show the division of the country into administrative units (districts, counties, etc) or statistical units (enumeration areas). Changes to data export organization When exporting the data the HQ user now decides whether to include or exclude the metadata into the export file (included by default). Metadata are descriptives that do not change during the survey, such as questionnaire in PDF, DDI, or JSON formats, etc. After the metadata is downloaded once, there is no need to download it again, but exclude it to make the downloads smaller and faster. Before shutting down the server when the data is downloaded for the final time, include the metadata into the download. This is especially important if the software was updated in the meanwhile to make sure the paradata corresponds exactly to the final export of data. The organization of the metadata in the Survey Solutions export file is described in the following article: Organization of meta-data storage in the exported data Paradata export files have the following changes: variable timestamp__utc shows the event timestamp in the UTC using the following format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ, and variable tz__offset contains the difference in hours between the time zone of the event origin and the UTC. For example, if the timestamp in paradata is recorded as 2020-09-19T16:45Z with time zone offset +3:00 then the clock was showing 19:45 of the same date at the location where the event originated. To prevent confusion, older variables timestamp and offset are no longer exported. If you have a script or other automated procedure to process paradata, please, adjust accordingly. Warning at deletion of a questionnaire from HQ To protect the users from accidental deletion of survey data, Survey Solutions now requires the admin user to retype the title of the questionnaire before it is deleted. Additional warning will indicate if there are any received assignments or rejected interviews on the tablets on which there may be unsynchronized changes, which will also be lost if the questionnaire is deleted. Other changes Supervisors can approve rejected interviews: Supervisors that have accidentally rejected interviews instead of approving them will now have an opportunity to approve them in the rejected state, in which case it is passed to the HQ-users. Previously this required cooperation of the interviewer to complete the interview first. Yet the supervisor must be aware that if a rejected interview has been already picked up by the interviewer on a tablet, then such a recall may create, potentially, an orphaned interview (interview from that tablet will not be accepted by the server after the recall.) Number of not answered questions: The list of the interviews at the supervisors/headquarters users interface now contains an additional column showing the number of enabled, but not answered questions (by interviewer, supervisor, or identifying questions). This column is given a title \u0026ldquo;Not answered\u0026rdquo;. Additionally the same statistic is added at export to the system-generated interview__diagnostics file, in the n_questions_unanswered variable.

Flexible Images Images included in static texts used to be only fixed. Now a single static text element can display different images depending on the situation in the interview. To utilize flexible images we reference a selector variable (a string variable) rather than attachment name directly. This variable may utilize answers to any questions or other variables in the questionnaire in its expression. If the string variable evaluates to the name of an attachment, that attachment will be displayed in the static text, otherwise no image will be displayed. The expression may be rather simple, such as a selector between two alternatives: (gender==1) ? \u0026quot;boy\u0026quot; : \u0026quot;girl\u0026quot; or utilize elaborate logic and complex expressions, for example, referring to lookup tables. The single static text is now sufficient where a hundred of static text elements with conditions was necessary earlier to show one of the alternative images, such as common in e.g. price surveys. Integrated export service in installation. Many users experienced problems configuring the Survey Solutions installation in a way that the main site can utilize the data export service and data export service can find back the main site. The previous release has already added a diagnostic health check facility to verify the correctness of settings (see release notes for version 20.07). This has now been simplified so that the users don’t have to reconfigure the settings of the export service when it is installed on the same machine (most users' situation) streamlining the installation by the user. Received date. Headquarters and supervisor users now see when (date) the interviewer has received a particular assignment or interview where they used to see just a binary attribute whether it has been already received by the tablet or not. This change serves two purposes: Helps understand whether it is reasonable to expect a response to this assignment already or not yet (for the management). Helps prevent errors of reassigning interviews/assignments to a different interviewer. The second is particularly important. Recall, that it is always dangerous to do a reassignment of something that an interviewer has already received on the tablet. This is because (s)he may have already started filling out that interview. But when it is absolutely unavoidable to make such a reassignment, reassigning the ones received last is safer, as there is less probability that the interviewer has already started working on it. Other changes Server administration items are moved from the administrator\u0026rsquo;s account menu, to the special Administration menu and the account menu only to contain items related to account management.

(The date of last synchronization of the tablet device was earlier available in the interviewer profiles). Web questionnaires will now have their questionnaire title also translatable (previously only available in the main language). Number of selections in limited multiselect questions is now displayed consistently below the selections in on tablets and on the web. The report on interviewers when exported in Excel or other format will have the accounts of interviewers sorted alphabetically (previously no sorting) and with proper formatting (thousands separators) of magnitudes where this is essential, such as size of a database or free storage space.

The detail can be read in a separate article dedicated to the map dashboard. Special section: cover page It is expected that any real survey will have one or more questions that help (interviewers) locate the respondents and help (supervisors) to distinguish between different interviews. A dedicated cover section is now always generated for every questionnaire created in Survey Solutions Designer. All questions placed to the cover page are automatically designated as identifying. Absence of identifying questions (empty cover page) is a common questionnaire design mistake. Read more about the role of the cover page in the following article: Special section: Cover Page Interviews reopen at the same point were left Interviews which were started, but not completed and are reopened for continuation will open at the last answered question. If the interviewer has been in one of the service sections: ‘cover’ or ‘complete’. This will simplify the work of the interviewers since they can continue the interviewer from where they left it. Improvements to web interviews Web interviews may be started only when they are assigned to an interviewer. This rule has caused a lot of confusion among the users (as evidenced by the number questions that came to the forum and support regarding this issue). The new version will give notable warnings to minimize the chances of interviews being assigned to a person other than an interviewer, for web interviews. At creation of an assignment - the message is blocking, meaning that a web-assignment will not be created with initial responsible different from interviewer: If subsequently the same assignment is being re-assigned a corresponding message is issued to the user performing the reassignment: The operation may still be performed at the responsibility of the user performing the action. Server administration diagnostics A new menu item has been added for the Survey Solutions server administrators: menu → administration → diagnostics, which brings a panel similar to shown here: This page shows two kinds of information: left side shows diagnostics related to server configuration, whether the settings are set up correctly and the different components are able to talk to each other; right side shows various metrics of the server performance, such as the CPU load, memory usage, number of concurrent queries, or the database footprint. Server administrators are requested to inspect the indications of this panel for common problems before bringing them up to the support. Other changes Cascading question can now be used in a cover section, (meaning it can function as identifying); Every questionnaire shall contain at least 1 section other than the cover section and at least one non-identifying question. Identifying question must have variable labels specified. One can no longer directly specify a question\u0026rsquo;s scope as identifying - all identifying questions are designated as such when they are placed into the cover page section. Server administrator can now download the server audit log as a single file in CSV, TAB, or XLSX format. The API endpoint for creating the assingments now supports all the same question types as preloading throught the interface (file upload). The time-axis of the cumulative chart report used to show duplicate labels under some conditions - this has been fixed.","keywords":["20.07"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"July 20, 2020","objectID":"03493ad53713c9f37d6d349346fbe309","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 20.07","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-20-07/","wordcount":665},{"content":" Overview of the map dashboard Survey Solutions map dashboard is an alternative representation of the regular dashboard where markers on the map indicate location of respondents. An interviewer switches to this view by pressing the map icon located in the toolbar next to the synchronization icon on the main dashboard. Several maps are offered for the Interviewer application (three online maps) and (1 offline map), and more offline maps can be uploaded by the headquarters users using the same procedure as the maps are assigned to be used in the geography-type question. Offline maps usually occupy considerable space in the tablet\u0026rsquo;s data storage, so only the necessary maps should be assigned to interviewers. The interviewer may select the map that is appropriate for the enumeration zone that she is working from a list of loaded maps. ESRI mapping components are utilized to visualize the map. The online maps are provided by various copyright holders, depending on the territory and may vary in recency and level of detail. The map dashboard indicates location based on the value of a single GPS-location question in the cover page (only one GPS-location question may be designated as) identifying. This means also, that this question may be called differently in different survey questionnaires, and Survey Solutions would still find it and plot on the map. Warning! There may be assignments/interviews on the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s dashboard without geographical position for any of the following reasons: there is no GPS question in the questionnaire, or location information hasn\u0026rsquo;t been preloaded into assignments, or location information hasn\u0026rsquo;t been recorded yet, or location of the interview is off the current visible map.

The cover page may contain some of the information that is present on an actual cover page of a paper prototype (if it exists) and may also contain other information. The objective of the cover page is to include identifying information that helps distinguish one interview from another; helps the field staff reach the respondent. It is possible that at the beginning of the survey the head office has absolutely no information about the respondents or their whereabouts. It is unlikely, though, that there is absolutely nothing distinguishable between the respondents. This information is provided for the convenience of the field staff. The Survey Solutions program uses a different set of identifiers internally, and it will not get confused even if there are full duplicates based on all the defined identifying fields. (Survey Solutions utilizes 32-alphanumeric digits IDs which preclude the duplicates in practice). Here are some examples of the questions that can be included into the cover section: name of the state or district, street address, phone number, email, respondent name, week when the interview is to be conducted, etc. Here are some examples of the questions that should not be included into the cover section: name of the interviewer, number of males/females/total among the residents of the household, interview status. Note: Not all the questions may be placed into the cover section, but only those that are listed as identifying at the following page: Design limitations by question type. Identifying questions may not have enabling conditions. If a question with an enabling condition is copied and pasted into the cover section it loses the attached enabling condition. Attention! Special behavior is provided for the questionnaires created in earlier versions of Survey Solutions (prior to July 20, 2020), continue reading below. Questionnaires created in older versions of Survey Solutions will display the identifying questions in two places: in the spot where they were added by the author and in a virtual cover page section. It is virtual in the sense that it didn\u0026rsquo;t exist when the questionnaire author was creating/editing the questionnaire before, but it manifests more obviously what the Survey Solutions will do, when interviews are created from this questionnaire during the data collection - a cover page section will be created automatically and all identifying questions are brought there in the same order as they are placed in the questionnaire. Questions appearing in the virtual section are readonly, and to edit them one shall edit them in the section where they were originally placed. To simplify locating them in the questionnaire the \u0026lsquo;Jump to edit\u0026rsquo; button is provided for each of them (in place of the \u0026lsquo;Save\u0026rsquo; button).

If it is present, it indicates that there was a problem reading the data stored in the database and transaction was aborted. This is a serious error, commonly caused by defective hardware. Most of the users are never concerned about the database used by Survey Solutions internally, since all the data structures needed for functioning of the software are created, updated, and deleted automatically. Technically, though, Survey Solutions uses PostgreSQL database for storing the data (this may change in the future, refer to the installation instructions for the current version, section on prerequisites/dependencies). If the above error message is encountered in the log files, the system administrator should plan for a recovery process.

Up to this version the export of data was possible only in the main language, which was not optimal for international teams collaborating on surveys. Now the export may be produced in any language included as a translation to the questionnaire. The corresponding language selector will appear at the export page if the selected questionnaire contains any translations in addition to the default language. This feature was requested multiple times in our users' forum here, here, as well as in numerous requests sent to the support email. You will also find that you can now rename the original language from the fixed word \u0026lsquo;Original\u0026rsquo; to any title that better describes the language. Reject interview to a different user In the previous versions if an interview needed to be rejected to a different user the supervisor had to do two actions: first reject the interview, then re-assign to another interviewer. In the new version this can be done as a single reject-to action. This is not just a convenience feature. This has important data integrity consequences. In the older versions if the original interviewer managed to synchronize between the two actions, he was getting the rejected interview, and so did the new interviewer. This resulted in unwanted duplicates if the supervisors were not paying attention. In this new version the rejection and re-assignment is done as a single atomic action, so that the original interviewer doesn’t stand a chance to collect the interview back on rejection (clearly, the supervisor can still reject to the original interviewer if she wishes to do so). Limit for lookup tables has been increased Lookup tables had a limit of 5,000 rows which was shorter than the maximum number of items in the categorical questions (15,000). This resulted in the need to break down conditions to seek values in 2 or 3 lookup tables, possible, but inconvenient for writing conditions and maintaining the tables. The new limit on the number of rows for the lookup tables (15,000) allows to accommodate the values necessary for validation of the categorical questions without the need to break them among multiple tables. Maps API A new API has been added to manipulate the maps assignments at the server. The following endpoints are added: Get information about the currently loaded maps; Get information about the currently made maps assignments; Assign maps to interviewers; Un-assign maps to interviewers; Delete maps. These queries are implemented through the graphql API functionality. See the full graphql schema at: https://demo.mysurvey.solutions/graphql/schema or the corresponding page at your server. Note also that all these queries must be executed as POST-type queries. Temporary web interviews As an efficiency mechanism, the new version of Survey Solutions will create web interviews as temporary interviews until the first answer to a question is given by the user. This will reduce the number of started interviews, which contain absolutely no user input. As soon as the user provides any input (such as answers a question, or writes a comment) the interview is getting placed into the list of the interviews. But if the user leaves the page without entering any information, the interview is disposed of.","keywords":["20.06"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"June 10, 2020","objectID":"b4a88d2bd3f840f60eb5212de923fc95","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 20.06","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-20-06/","wordcount":590},{"content":" Version 20.08 and newer Version 20.08 is delivered with export service embedded within Headquarters application.

At this time consider generating a new batch of the recovery codes. Resetting authenticator Resetting authenticator allows to regenerate the private secret value associated with the user account. As a consequence, any codes that are generated by the authenticator app(s) that were earlier set up with this account will no longer be valid, and these apps will need to be re-configured again using the newly displayed QR-code. If you chose to reset the authenticator, but do not enter the new verification code, your account will be left without the two factor authentication. Resetting the authenticator does not disable the recovery codes. A batch of new recovery codes may be generated if necessary using the procedure outlined above. Resetting two factor authentication Any user that has his access lost because of the two factor authentication must refer to a higher positioned user: interviewers to supervisor, supervisor to headquarters, headquarters to admin. That user will be able to turn off the two factor authentication or reset it to be used with a different device. If this reset is done remotely the QR-code may not be used, and the user should enter into the Authenticator App the shared key that is displayed directly above the QR-code. The admin user that has lost the possibility to enter the site because of the two factor authentication (e.g. the phone lost and recovery codes exhausted) will need to directly access the server to reset his two factor authentication settings.

Two-factor authentication (2FA). Filtering of interviews by identifying fields. Split of the HQ list of interviews into processed and in-progress Other changes. Partial synchronization of interviews. Earlier versions of Survey Solutions were sending only completed interviews from the tablet to the server. A number of our users have described partial synchronization of the interviews as extremely important for their surveys. Partial synchronization allows sending the information from the tablet to the server, while keeping the interview data on the tablet. This has numerous advantages, among which: Increased reliability: if the tablet is lost or damaged, the server will contain the last state of the interview when it was synchronized, and the interviewer will be able to resume from that state on a different device; Better interaction with the supervisor, who can now start reviewing (and commenting) the beginning of the interview even before it is fully realized. But partial synchronization comes at a cost of higher traffic, which may or may not be desirable. Hence the partial synchronization is an opt-in. Whether to enable partial synchronization is up to the administrator of the server, who can enable it in the server\u0026rsquo;s settings. Two-factor authentication (2FA) Two-factor authentication enhances security of the system by requiring an additional method of confirming the identity of the user. Compared to simple password-based systems, this method relies on confirmation on two channels: Something the user knows (password); Something the user has (security token). The security token is typically implemented as a software running on the user’s phone with a wide range of implementations for various platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, Windows Mobile, etc). Any user of Survey Solutions server can now enable the two-factor authentication for his (her) account in the account profile. Read more about how to set up and use the two factor authentication in this article. Filtering interviews by identifying questions The list of interviews can contain many thousands of interviews in the large surveys. Locating specific interviews may be overwhelming. That’s why we have introduced the filter for interviews based on the identifying questions (defined by the Designer). To use the filters, first select the questionnaire and version (since the questions may differ in different questionnaires), then click Questions selector button and select the questions you want to be part of the filter and confirm your selection with OK button. Then specify the values you want to be used to filter the interviews, for example, only interviews from a particular enumeration area, state, or phone number. Split of the HQ list of interviews into processed and in-progress Large surveys may run for years and involve conducting millions of interviews. Usually, once they are approved by the Headquarters users, that’s the terminal state and no further actions are needed. The new feature allows to de-clutter the HQ-users' workspace. By default now the HQ-user sees the list of the interviews that are not approved by the HQ yet (in all other statuses). This will allow them to focus on the tasks that are still in the progress. If necessary, all interviews may be seen at the same time by switching the corresponding filter setting. Other changes: The list of the interviews is now reformatted to use the space within the columns more efficiently, variable labels of identifying questions are used instead of question texts where provided, and the column width is automatically adjusted to accommodate more content when multiple identifying questions are defined in the questionnaire. Interviews that are approved by the Headquarters users are no longer displayed in the list of the interviews with default settings as they need no further processing. Tablets running earlier versions of the interviewer app may send an interview to the updated server (to 20.5) without an update, but will require an update when receiving rejected interviews. This is normal. Sections in disabled state were previously always hidden. Now they will obey their individual hide-if-disabled flag. Check your earlier designed questionnaires to verify their behavior. Assignments are sorted on the tablets in the natural order of their identifying fields: first by the first identifying fields, then (if there are ties) by the second identifying field, and so on. This should simplify locating assignments in the dashboard that are targeting respondents in the same or near-by areas. When assignments being preloaded contain a GPS question that has values for latitude and longitude specified will also preload the GPS acquisition date with a default value. Rejection notifications to the respondents were previously not delivered through the mass mail service for web interviews (https://forum.mysurvey.solutions/t/download-web-link/2399).","keywords":["20.05"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"May 13, 2020","objectID":"7543179f7a1c855eba7b7c4e4159e9e1","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 20.05","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-20-05/","wordcount":765},{"content":" Installation of Survey Solutions on Amazon AWS The installation consists of the following steps: Create security group for web server and RDS to be able to communicate Create PostgreSQL instance Create EC2 instance for running Survey Solutions Install Survey Solutions Create security group In order to have connection between Survey Solutions and PostgreSQL you can create new security group as described in here.

The link to the site will be automatically added to your start menu, but you can always access it by directly typing the address in the browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar. In order to check if the application is running correctly you can open http://localhost:9700/.hc URL. It should output Healthy message. Post installation configuration The post-installation configuration involves the following: adjusting the site bindings; SSL certificate; adjusting the firewall rules; adjusting the load balancer; adjusting the application configuration: BaseURL; Captcha; Google Maps; GeoTIFF. Adjusting the site bindings By default Survey Solutions is installed as a web application and runs behind the IIS web server. By default it uses port 9700. This will require all users to add the port number :9700 when referring to your server in any URL. Most firewalls will block custom ports by default and additional configuration may be required to have the server accessible from external networks/Internet. If you need to change port you can do it in the IIS configuration manager. To access it right click on start menu, select run option and execute the inetmgr command. In the IIS Manager you will find the Survey Solutions application: 📷 Survey Solutions in IIS Manager If you click on the Bindings... link in the right panel you will be able to add new ports, such as 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. SSL certificate If your Survey Solutions instance is exposed to the public in the Internet, it is highly recommended to setup SSL encryption for web server by applying an SSL certificate. The configuration depends on the certificate provider that you choose, so refer to their documentation on how to setup IIS. Firewall rules To permit communication of Survey Solutions with the Designer and other utilized services you may need to enable certain ports or types of communication as listed below. The instructions vary by type of the security software used. See #3 in the FAQ for IT for common security software instructions. allow incoming connections to the port that you\u0026rsquo;ve set up the server binding of Survey Solutions; allow outgoing connections to the Designer site: https://designer.mysurvey.solutions; allow outgoing connections to the Survey Solutions site: https://mysurvey.solutions. In addition expect the client (browser) to send queries to the Maps server being used: typically https://maps.googleapis.com and https://google.com (or see here for alternative settings for China); send queries to the CAPTCHA server being used (if it is used): https://www.google.com and https://www.gstatic.com Survey Solutions operates with HTTP/HTTPS requests that may be rather large (multiple MB). Your server must be configured to receive and process such queries (rather than block them). This may necessitate additional WAF configuration. If this is not permitted, the interviewers may not be able to synchronize their tablets. Load balancer If you are using a load balancer, please make sure that it is configured to use: sticky sessions, and web sockets. If this is not satisfied, web interviews will not work resulting in errors for the respondents (this may not be immediately obvious to the person setting up the Survey Solutions server). Survey Solutions application configuration Open the /Site folder where Survey Solutions is installed, and open appsettings.Production.ini file. This file will not be replaced during application upgrades and will retain your local server configuration. 📷 Survey Solutions configuration file Base URL If your server has domain name you need to change BaseUrl value to the name you have (without trailing slash at the end of the URL). Make sure that this URL can be used to open Survey Solutions app from server where application is installed, otherwise export won\u0026rsquo;t work. Example of an ini-file with configured base URL: [Headquarters] BaseUrl=https://demo.mysurvey.solutions Captcha A captcha is used to safeguard the application from brute force attacks on user accounts and for protection of web mode from automatic creation of interviews. Survey Solutions may utilize a built-in (hosted) implementation of captcha (default) or an external reCAPTCHA provided by Google (to be configured as per instructions below). To take advantage of the more secure reCAPTCHA implementation by Google, you need to set it up in the Google reCAPTCHA admin and record the 2 issued keys into your configuration file. Navigate to creation page to register a new captcha. Click on the ℹ️-icons will give you helpful hints on how to fill out that form. Specify your public DNS name that is configured in Survey Solutions BaseUrl property for the site name. When selecting the reCAPTCHA type, select version 2 (\u0026quot;reCAPTCHA v2\u0026quot;). You can specify additional emails to receive notifications on problems or increase in suspicious traffic (alerts are issued by Google).

There are no forms to fill and the server becomes available shortly after the request is submitted. The address of the server is https://username-demo.mysurvey.solutions and cannot be changed. The server and all stored data will be automatically deleted 30 days after it was created. A PDS may not be extended, but can be requested again after it expires. We do not do backups of data stored on PDS and there is no possibility for any data recovery after the site has been stopped (all content is deleted immediately). Once a PDS is created for a user, it may not be transferred to another user. The objective of a PDS is to give the user a playground to study and experiment and not to collect any real survey data.

They were always exported with the answers to the questions in the final dataset. This version allows the designer of the questionnaire to mark certain variables as non-exportable. Such variables are considered temporary, needed only during the interview execution, and not exported with the survey data. Filter in categorical questions linked to a list Linked-to-list questions were earlier not allowed to have filters. This is now permitted. This is commonly needed when we need to do double screening, such as \u0026ldquo;Who is employed?\u0026quot; and then from the selected individuals only answer \u0026ldquo;Who has more than one job?\u0026quot;. Earlier this was possible only if there was a roster triggered by the members list, now such roster is no longer a requirement. Customization of labels on the roster buttons The author of the questionnaire can now customize the appearance of the titles on the roster buttons, when the newly added checkbox is checked. For example, the above setup will display \u0026ldquo;Max Musterman, 45\u0026rdquo; instead of just \u0026ldquo;Max Musterman\u0026rdquo;. Do not require text For static texts mentioning attachments (pictures) there is no longer requirement to include some descriptive text. This is convenient for inclusion of logos and other uses where no explanatory text is needed. GPS pick from map In the assignment creation dialog the headquarters user can now specify the value of the identifying GPS question by pointing to a particular location on the map. Export v2 API The export API has been changed. The initial post request to generate the export data file now returns a numeric JobID, which must be used in all subsequent requests related to that export job (including obtaining the status of a job and picking the resulting export file) instead of the original combination of the export parameters. The new API is accessed through the v2 prefix. The old procedure for data export (accessible via the v1 prefix) continues to work, but will be phased out in the future releases. If you are using API for data export, update your code at the soonest. Export format changes The system-generated file assignment__actions now contains information on all assignments. In earlier versions it contained only information on assignments that originated the interviews included in the particular export file.

Access to an electric outlet/power to recharge the tablet and the charger/cable suitable for your tablet model. Before you start Before you start collecting the interviews, find in your tablet the Survey Solutions Interviewer application. Its icon looks like this: Click on it and enter exactly the three parameters you’ve got from the statistical office: the server address (synchronization point), the login, and the password. Connect to the internet and click SIGN IN. You will see the SYNCHRONIZE button if you’ve entered all three parameters exactly. If there was any error, or you are not online, the software will not let you in. If you can’t find the Interviewer App it may not have been installed for you in the office. In this case either get back to the office or contact it by phone to follow the instructions of the local IT-support person who will guide you through the installation process. Daily algorithm On any day when you work, follow this algorithm: At the beginning of your shift, connect to the internet, login to the Interviewer App, and synchronize by pressing the SYNCHRONIZE button in the dashboard. It is important that you complete synchronization. If for any reason (typically connectivity/signal strength) your synchronization doesn’t succeed, you will see an error message and need to repeat the synchronization by pressing the same button again. After synchronization completes you will receive one or more assignments and possibly rejected interviews. Each is appearing as a card on your dashboard. Each card contains a field named PHONE with a phone number. Cards may also contain a person’s name and other identifying information, and possibly a comment on when the number should be dialed. If there is no comment on when to dial, that phone may be called at any time. Review the cards and determine which one you can contact next. If you have any interviews rejected by your supervisor, give them the priority, then the started interviews that you haven’t finalized, then all the remaining interviews. Open the interview by clicking the OPEN button on the interview (or START NEW for new interviews). Take the phone and dial the phone number you are seeing on the interview cover page. Listen carefully. You may end up in one of the situations below. You will need to mark this situation in the contact outcome in the interview. (Only frequent situations are listed here, your particular questionnaire may provide additional options). A) The phone is not answered after at least 1 minute of waiting (or the longest allowed by your operator); B) You get a busy signal; C) The phone is answered and immediately hang up; D) The phone is answered by an answering machine; E) The phone is answered by a FAX or a modem device. F) The phone is answered by a person. G) The operator tells you that the phone is not valid or not in service. H) The operator tells you that connection is not possible at this time. Z) All other outcomes. Make sure you record the result of the contact attempt in the interview. Depending on the result of the contact attempt you will: If the phone is answered by a person (f), proceed with the interview. For (a), (b), ( c), (d), and (h) try to reach the same number at a later time. For (e), (g), and (z) you reach the end of this interview. Make sure you mark it as completed. If you’ve marked the interview as completed, synchronize from the dashboard. Then proceed to the next appropriate card. As you are doing the interview, read the texts from the screen that are marked with READ: prompt. Also read the questions and give the respondent time to think about the answer. When the answer is given, record the answer into the field provided under the question or select the appropriate option of categorical questions. Sometimes you may need to read the options, such as with Y/N-multiselect questions. As a result of you entering the answers some new questions/sections may appear in the interview or others disappear. Only ask questions that you are seeing suggested by the Interviewer App, even if you remember that you’ve asked different questions of a different respondent. Just like in CAPI interviews, you may encounter error messages. For example: \u0026ldquo;Value X is too large\u0026rdquo;. Before turning it to the respondent, double-check that the value you’ve entered is indeed the value that the respondent just told you. It may be a simple typing/entry error. Other situations you need to clarify with the respondent. For example: \u0026ldquo;You have told me earlier that there are 3 members in your household. Yet now you are telling me that 4 members are having fever today. Perhaps, you didn’t count someone as a household member earlier?\u0026quot; During the interview the respondent may decide to interrupt the interview.

If at step 14 the interview was completed, or the respondent refused to finish categorically, or designated the call back time after the end of your shift, mark the interview as completed and synchronize at the dashboard. Completed synchronized interviews will be removed from your dashboard. Remember that you are using a phone to make the calls. Marking the interview as completed will not hang up the phone! If you agreed with the respondent to make another call during the current shift, you don’t have to mark the interview as completed and synchronize. In this case it is important that you make the contact attempt at the designated time during the current shift and record the corresponding status, and possibly the next contact appointment. At the end of your shift do a final synchronization (and make sure it is successful). Do not start new interviews after this synchronization. Next time you work, proceed to step #1. You may find that you have received some of the new assignments and some interviews rejected by the supervisors. Not all the interviews that were marked to be continued today may be returned to you \u0026ndash; your supervisor may decide that they can be better finished by other interviewers. Notes: Not all tablets provide a possibility to connect to 3G/4G networks for sending the data (may or may not be having a SIM-card slot and corresponding modem). If your tablet is capable of connecting to WiFi networks only, you will need to set up such a network. If the phone used for calls is a smartphone, it may have a capability to raise an access point and forward the WiFi connection to the internet through 3G/4G. If the phone is not capable of providing such a connectivity, a combination of a battery-operated router and 3G/4G dongle, or a MiFi-type device can provide the needed functionality. Any synchronization requires an internet connection. If synchronization doesn’t succeed - make sure you are connected to the internet, then try again. The synchronization may fail even while connected if the signal is too weak. Again, just retry the synchronization process. If at any time you find that you’ve exhausted the allowance for wireless connection (either on the phone you make your phone calls with, or on the tablet itself) contact your supervisor and explain. It is possible that the respondent will request the interview may be continued on the next day \u0026ldquo;at any time\u0026rdquo;. Prepare before the start of the interview with a couple of slots that you know are possible for the next day. This will help arrange a schedule with no conflicting appointments. Use only the tablet provided to you by the office, not any other device. If you attempt to login to any other device, this will invalidate your tablet (relinking) with a loss of all data. Your supervisor may tell you that she will not be reviewing your unfinished interviews nightly. Then you don’t have to complete and synchronize unfinished interviews (step #15). But make sure you’ve discussed this with your supervisor and reached this agreement. In any case you should synchronize at the beginning and end of every shift.

Listen carefully. You may end up in one of the situations below. You will need to mark this situation in the contact outcome in the interview. (Only frequent situations are listed here, your particular questionnaire may provide additional options). A) The phone is not answered after at least 1 minute of waiting (or the longest allowed by your operator); B) You get a busy signal; C) The phone is answered and immediately hang up; D) The phone is answered by an answering machine; E) The phone is answered by a FAX or a modem device. F) The phone is answered by a person. G) The operator tells you that the phone is not valid or not in service. H) The operator tells you that connection is not possible at this time. Z) All other outcomes. Make sure you record the result of the contact attempt in the interview. Depending on the result of the contact attempt you will: If the phone is answered by a person (f), proceed with the interview. For (a), (b), ( c), (d), and (h) try to reach the same number at a later time. For (e), (g), and (z) you reach the end of this interview. Make sure you mark it as completed. If you’ve marked the interview as completed, proceed to the next work item. As you are doing the interview, read the texts from the screen that are marked with READ: prompt. Also read the questions and give the respondent time to think about the answer. When the answer is given, record the answer into the field provided under the question or select the appropriate option of categorical questions. Sometimes you may need to read the options, such as with Y/N-multiselect questions. As a result of you entering the answers some new questions/sections may appear in the interview or others disappear. Only ask questions that you are seeing suggested by the Interviewer App, even if you remember that you’ve asked different questions of a different respondent. Just like in CAPI interviews, you may encounter error messages. For example: \u0026ldquo;Value X is too large\u0026rdquo;. Before turning it to the respondent, double-check that the value you’ve entered is indeed the value that the respondent just told you. It may be a simple typing/entry error. Other situations you need to clarify with the respondent. For example: \u0026ldquo;You have told me earlier that there are 3 members in your household. Yet now you are telling me that 4 members are having fever today. Perhaps, you didn’t count someone as a household member earlier?\u0026quot; During the interview the respondent may decide to interrupt the interview. If you may not finish the interview at this time, make a note in the final section that the interview is not finished, ask the respondent when is the nearest convenient time to call back, and record this time in the final section of the interview. If the respondent refuses categorically to finish the interview, make sure that you record the corresponding outcome and any reason/explanation provided (interview is too long, questions are too sensitive, respondent doesn’t see the purpose, etc). If at step 14 the interview was finished, or the respondent refused to finish categorically, mark the interview as completed. Remember that you are using","keywords":["web interviewer","telephone","phone","cati"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"March 10, 2021","objectID":"acb5ca772ae1ef2bb114e46900edc02c","section":"Interviewer","title":"Web Interviewer Retraining Instructions","type":"interviewer","url":"/interviewer/web-interviewer/web-interviewer-instr/","wordcount":1348},{"content":" a phone to make the calls. Marking the interview as completed will not hang up the phone! If you agreed with the respondent to make another call during the current shift it is important that you make the contact attempt at the designated time during the current shift and record the corresponding status, and possibly the next contact appointment. Log out from the website at the end of your shift. Next time you work, proceed to step #1. You may find some new assignments and some interviews rejected by the supervisors at your dashboard as you keep on working. Not all the interviews that were marked to be continued may be returned to you \u0026ndash; your supervisor may decide that they can be better finished by other interviewers. Notes: Your work as the web-interviewer will require internet connectivity for the whole duration of the interview. Avoid the use of any other software that may compete for the bandwidth (YouTube, messengers, games, music players, etc). If at any time you find that you’ve exhausted the allowance for wireless connection (either on the phone you make your phone calls with, or on line you are using for accessing the internet) contact your supervisor and explain. It is possible that the respondent will request the interview may be continued on the next day \u0026ldquo;at any time\u0026rdquo;. Prepare before the start of the interview with a couple of slots that you know are possible for the next day. This will help arrange a schedule with no conflicting appointments. While it is technically possible to log in from two different devices it is not recommended. Choose one device and one browser you are most comfortable with, and stick to working with it. It may be technically possible to use the same computer for also making the calls through Skype or other messenger capable of connecting to phone networks. In that case you may not need the phone for making the calls (requirement 1). Make sure this mode provides both sufficient sound quality for maintaining the conversation and reliable connectivity to the data site.","keywords":["web interviewer","telephone","phone","cati"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"March 10, 2021","objectID":"acb5ca772ae1ef2bb114e46900edc02c","section":"Interviewer","title":"Web Interviewer Retraining Instructions","type":"interviewer","url":"/interviewer/web-interviewer/web-interviewer-instr/","wordcount":1348},{"content":" Survey Solutions v20.03 adds the following useful features: Changes to GPS question behavior Recorded coordinates are rendered as a clickable link, which when clicked, opens a Google-map centered at the recorded location. Rendering of the map preview on the tablet requires Google-services to be installed on the tablet. Changes to audio audit option. The option to activate the Audio Audit has now been moved from the questionnaire context menu to the questionnaire details page. Changes to assignments upload dialog Assignments are created sequentially, one at a time. If multiple HQ users attempt to upload their samples at the same time, the first one will succeed, but the second will need to wait the first upload to finish. Survey Solutions will display the corresponding informational message, indicating which other user has started the upload and the estimated time remaining until finish: Changes to questionnaire import dialog Importing a questionnaire is not instantaneous, especially in the case where the questionnaire contains multiple language translations that need to be rendered as separate PDF documents. The dialog displayed during importing the questionnaire will now show the progress of the import operation and estimated time to complete it. API Changes A new API query is now available to create users. The API documentation has also been reformatted and refined. Designer can copy questions with reusable categories Designers of questionnaires can now copy questions with reusable categories from one questionnaire to another. If the questionnaire doesn’t have the same matching categories, they will also be copied from the source questionnaire. Local server password policies Survey Solutions will obey password policies set up in the appsettings.production.ini file of the standalone data server. The administrator of the standalone server may adjust these policies to differ from the default requirements (for example to require passwords to be longer, or utilize certain types of characters). All Survey Solutions cloud servers (new and existing) continue using the same password policies. Local server metrics A public metrics page is introduced for every standalone server: www.YOURSERVERNAME.com/metrics. This page publishes various statuses and performance indicators of the server. The data is published in the prometheus format. Old system log is no longer available We kept the old format of the system log for compatibility in a few recent versions.

Besides the standard GUI, it also comes with a powerful API. To further facilitate its integration in a fully automated workflow we have developed this R package, which covers almost all of the available API calls. This article gives you an overview of the functions implemented in this package. The package can be considered as being a API \u0026ldquo;bare bone\u0026rdquo;, as it implements the Survey Solutions API calls without substantial modification. However, this is not true for the data export function as well as for the paradata. Modification was necessary to facilitate workflow integration. See the details in the corresponding documentation. Please be aware, that this package makes heavy use of data.table, and this is also continued in this vignette. In case you are not familiar with it yet, refer to this introduction. API credentials To use the API you first need to set-up the API user on your Survey Solutions server. See here for details. After this done, you can use the suso_set_key() function, to provide your credentials. library(SurveySolutionsAPI) suso_clear_keys() suso_set_key(\u0026#34;https://xxx.mysurvey.solutions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;xxxxxx\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;xxxxxxx\u0026#34;) suso_keys() #\u0026gt; $suso #\u0026gt; $suso$susoServer #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026#34;https://xxx.mysurvey.solutions\u0026#34; #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; $suso$susoUser #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026#34;xxxxxx\u0026#34; #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; $suso$susoPass #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026#34;xxxxxxx\u0026#34; #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; attr(,\u0026#34;class\u0026#34;) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026#34;suso_api\u0026#34; After this is done, there is no need to provide the credentials for every API call again. They are stored until the end of your current session. There is also a function to check if your credentials work. suso_PwCheck() #\u0026gt; Response [https://mcw2.mysurvey.solutions/api/v1/supervisors?limit=200] #\u0026gt; Date: 2020-02-25 02:00 #\u0026gt; Status: 200 #\u0026gt; Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 #\u0026gt; Size: 471 B It calls the supervisor API, and returns the response. If the return value is 200, then your connection and credentials are OK.

Please bear in mind, that paradata files can be fairly big, and processing it may require a large working memory. To decrease the load there are also 3 parameters you can change, these are: onlyActiveEvents, if TRUE it processes only the active events initiated by users. allResponses, if FALSE, does not process all response values, nevertheless they are still included in a single column. Otherwise, they are separated by column. Running the same call again without passive events and without all responses processed, reduces processing time significantly. system.time(para2 \u0026lt;- suso_export_paradata(questID = questlist[2, QuestionnaireId], version = questlist[2, Version], reloadTimeDiff = 24, onlyActiveEvents = T, allResponses = F)) #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; The last file has been created 5 hours ago. #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; Starting download \u0026amp; file extraction. #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; Calculating Response Timings. #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; Extracting GPS variable. #\u0026gt; Processing: #\u0026gt; AnswerSet #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; AnswerRemoved #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; ApproveByHeadquarter #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; Restarted #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; Reject #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; Export \u0026amp; Transformation finished. #\u0026gt; user system elapsed #\u0026gt; 0.908 0.004 0.357 As you see from the system timings, changing these parameters reduces processing time significantly.

In this case a call-centre is usually set up, with interviewers working from this office by reaching out the respondents by phone. The identifying fields of assignments are supposed to be pre-filled with the proper phone numbers that the interviewers will dial to get a response. This allows to avoid purchasing the tablets and to re-use the computer equipment available in the existing call-centre. If the survey is a CATI survey, the designer of the questionnaire should avoid the questions that are not supported under such circumstances (picture, GPS, etc), and, perhaps, extend the interview result codes to include telephone-related outcomes: respondent out of the service area; phone number always busy; phone number answered by fax, modem, or other similar device; phone number not serviced or not valid anymore; phone number belongs to/call is answered by a different person; etc. A very extensive guide on the result codes is published on the site of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR): \u0026ldquo;Standard Definitions.

In this case all the started interviews are marked as received by the tablet, and are still visible on the server (in web interviewer, as well as for the supervisor and HQ users). But the interviewer should not and may not make any changes to the interview since it was already received on the tablet. If he/she tries to do such a change, an error message will be indicated and the software will refuse the change: The continuation of an interview started on the tablet on the server through web interviewer is only possible throgh completion and rejection by the supervisor, since the server receives only those interviews from the Interviewer App that are marked as \u0026lsquo;Completed\u0026rsquo; by the interviewer. Once the interview is rejected by the supervisor it will be available in the web interviewer until the next synchronization of the tablet. It is totally fine for some interviewers to be using the Interviewer App on tablets, and other interviewers using the web interviewer facility even within the same survey. But the discipline described above is to be observed if any interviewer uses both tools. To simplify the workflow, the coordinator of the survey should decide on a single tool to be used by every interviewer/account and all interviewers should stick to it. Any deviation from this rule should be rehearsed during the planning of the survey to determine suitability for a particular scenario.","keywords":["web interviewer"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"March 30, 2020","objectID":"fd588b954a0d3b4faa129e1fe6162318","section":"Interviewer","title":"Web Interviewer Important Notes","type":"interviewer","url":"/interviewer/web-interviewer/web-interviewer-important-notes/","wordcount":289},{"content":" Headquarters and administrator users may create new interviewer accounts.

The difference is essential: In the first case the person filling out the interview is a known member of the team, has an account created in the system, assigned to a team of a certain supervisor and so on. We use this mode when e.g. we set up a call centre and our interviewers don\u0026rsquo;t physically travel to the respondent, so don\u0026rsquo;t need a mobile device (tablet) or to work offline (disconnected), but collect multiple interviews and report to a certain supervisor; In the second case, the respondent doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an account in the system, and could in general be anonymous, and typically only one interview in the survey is filled out by each respondent. This article is dedicated to the discussion of the second case, the setup of the web survey for self-enumeration. The first case is described in details in the topic dedicated to the web-interviewer. Advantages and disadvantages Web enumeration has numerous advantages to the face-to-face interviewing: doesn\u0026rsquo;t require interviewers, their training and travel time; doesn\u0026rsquo;t require interviewer equipment (tablets) as data entry will be performed by the respondent using his/her device; the whole survey can be faster (theoretically can be completed within a day); some sensitive questions may be easier to answer in the absence of interviewer; it may be possible to reach respondents, which would otherwise be not reachable (for example, those living in remote places, or conflict areas). There are equally-important concerns: it may be difficult for a respondent to fully understand the survey and complete a complex questionnaire without guidance of an interviewer, who has had some training on the topic; survey coordinator must be able to contact respondents to invite them to take a survey (for example, per email); respondents must have access to and be able to use a device (computer/tablet/smartphone) with internet access. A survey coordinator should carefully weight the costs and the benefits, as well as estimate the impact of the mode of collection on the quality of data. Web-interviewing may introduce an essential bias into the data stemming from self-selection on the basis of age, literacy, IT-literacy, income, etc. In many cases the self-enumeration is used as a supplementary tool to face-to-face interviewing in an attempt to reach the representative audience in a cost-effective manner. Setting up a CAWI survey Conducting a CAWI survey requires the following: Compose the questionnaire. Import the questionnaire to the data server. Make web-assignments for the survey. Activate the web-survey mode. Distribute the links. Review incoming data/follow up with the respondents if necessary. De-activate the web-survey mode. Below we discuss these steps in more detail. 1. Composing the questionnaire There is hardly any difference in the questionnaire for the web interviews. You can generally use the same questionnaire that you use for the face-to-face interviews also for the web interviews, but it is worth to: Explain the structure of the questionnaire to the respondent and give an idea about how to navigate through the modules; Check the wording of the questions - without the interviewers some things may be not clear, explain them in the instructions; Check the error messages - they must be clear to the respondent. Remember that the respondent wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the training session that the interviewers typically get before the survey, so the questionnaire must be more \u0026lsquo;user-friendly\u0026rsquo;. 2. Importing the questionnaire There is no difference of this step relative to importing the questionnaire for a face-to-face interviewing. Note that if you import a different version of the same questionnaire to the data server, the web mode for it (step #4) will need to be activated again, specifically for each version. 3. Make web-assignments Once you import the questionnaire, you will need to create web-assignments. They are just like the regular assignments, but the following properties are important or exist only for web-assignments: Preloading column Property Meaning _webmode Web mode A simple boolean flag that is raised if the assignment is intended to be completed directly by the respondent. In the preloading file 1 corresponds to web mode, and zero or not specified value corresponds to no web mode for the assignment. _email Email Email address of the respondent (optional) _password Password if a password (optional) is specified, interviews based on this assignment will be protected by the password, which also needs to be communicated to the prospective respondents of the survey. See below on password rules. _responsible Responsible person Account of the person responsible for the assignment. _quantity Quantity Number of interviews that may be generated from this assignment; -1 corresponds to unlimited amount. In addition to the above properties, the web assignments have all the properties of the regular assignments. So that we can, for example, specify the values for identifying questions (fields). The email and password only make sense for the web mode assignments and are not effective for the regular assignments. The values of all of these properties can be seen in the corresponding columns of the table showing the assignments (Menu → Survey Setup → Assignments). For a CAWI survey, set the value of _webmode to 1 for all assignments. For a mixed survey, only for those assignments that must be filled out by the respondents through the web. Even though the CAWI survey is done through a self-enumeration (by the respondent) the person responsible for the assignment must be specified and be in the role of interviewer. A web assignment will not be created if it is made in the name of a user in a different role and you will get a corresponding error message. The combination of the assignment\u0026rsquo;s quantity, email and password will determine the overall protocol of the survey. When the email is specified during the assignment creation, the Survey Solutions can utilize one of the bulk email delivery services to deliver the invitations for the","keywords":["web interviewing","CAWI","Self-enumeration"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"October 30, 2020","objectID":"fc794954d329763835019f3e50ada90b","section":"Headquarters","title":"Web Interviewing","type":"headquarters","url":"/headquarters/cawi/web-interviewing/","wordcount":2233},{"content":" survey. If these services have not been configured yet, the headquarters user must contact the server administrator, as such configuration requires administrator\u0026rsquo;s access level. # Properties Situation 1 quantity=-1 email=..empty.. password=..empty.. Typical setup for a public opinion survey - one link is made public through any media (newspaper, TV, website). All visitors of the link will have an opportunity to fill out an interview. If the bulk email delivery service has been set up, at the start of the interview they will have a possibility to enter their email, so that they will receive a link to follow in case their session is interrupted and they need to continue the started interview. There is no limit to the number of interviews to be collected. 2 quantity=-1 email=..empty.. password=..specified.. Typical setup for a non-public survey of unknown audience, for example, visitors to a conference. The password must be made available to them (e.g. written on the board, or announced to them). The role of the password is to separate this group from all the other people who are not exposed and not the focus of the study. There is no limit to the number of interviews to be collected. 3 quantity=-1 email=..specified.. password=..specified.. Typical for monitoring surveys - the same respondent must authenticate himself/herself with the password, and can submit an unlimited number of interviews (presumably regulated by the established protocol: daily, weekly, monthly, etc, or when a particular event happens, such as a patient arrives with a particular symptom). 4 quantity=1 email=..specified.. password=..specified.. Typical for private opinion surveys - the respondents are invited directly and can submit only one interview. To start the interview they must follow the link and confirm their access with the issued password. The interview may be completed in multiple seatings. If the respondent interrupts the interview, he/she can continue by clicking the same link received in the original invitation. 5 quantity=1 email=..specified.. password=..empty.. Similar to the above, but the respondents do not need to enter the password to start their interviews, just click on their personalized links. 6 quantity=1 email=..empty.. password=..specified.. Typical for private opinion surveys - the respondents can submit only one interview. To start the interview they must follow the link and confirm their access with the issued password. The interview may be completed in multiple seatings. If the respondent interrupts the interview, he/she can continue by clicking the original link. The passwords must be unique in this case, and the link distributed using alternative means. 7 quantity=1 email=..empty.. password=..empty.. This combination is not acceptable. 8 quantity=N email= password= Same as the case above where quantity is -1, except that the number of responses is not infinite, but is limited to N interviews. First N respondents will start the interviews, other respondents will get a message indicating their participation is no longer needed. 4. Activate the web-survey mode. Once the assignments are created the survey coordinator needs to set up and activate the web mode of data collection for the survey. This is available by calling the context menu for the questionnaire in the Survey Setup: Menu → Survey Setup → Web interview setup. Depending on the objectives and implementation of the survey you may need to adjust the: templates for the web pages visible to the survey participants; templates for email messages that are sent as notifications to the survey participants. At the next page the template messages for invitations/reminders/notifications may be edited and the web mode activated (the green START button) or deactivated (the red STOP WEB INTERVIEW button). Any generated links remain ineffective when the survey is not in the web mode even if the link has been already sent to the respondent. 5. Deliver links Depending on the scenario of the survey as outlined by the table in step #3, you will have one or multiple links to be delivered to the respondents. Note that in any of the cases, Survey Solutions doesn\u0026rsquo;t send the invitations/notifications directly, but utilizes a special bulk email delivery service to deliver the corresponding messages. Refer to the corresponding article on how to set it up. Once it is set up, one can go to Menu → Survey Setup → your questionnaire name → Send invitations to send out the invitation emails. If this service is not set up by the server administrator, then it is his/her responsibility to distribute the appropriate messages among the respondents using any alternative tools. The links can be downloaded by going to Menu → Survey Setup → your questionnaire name → Download web links. After the links have been sent to the respondents it is important not to change the responsible person for an assignment to anyone except an interviewer as this will invalidate it (you will get a warning if you try). Note that this may be an unintended indirect consequence of your actions, such as relocating an interviewer to another team leaving his assignments in the original team. 6. Review incoming data Once a CAWI survey is running, the interviews will appear in the list as soon as they are started. The respondents may still be working at them and their status will be InterviewerAssigned. This status is only attributable to CAWI interviews. Any interviews received from tablets will show up on the server already in the Completed status. The supervisors are expected to review as soon as possible the interviews in the status Completed, and either to approve or reject them. Note that even though there is a rejection notification template in the set of user-configurable notification templates for a survey, rejection notifications are NOT sent out at all, and the supervisor will need to manually reallocate the rejected interview to a real interviewer to follow up with the respondent by using phone (see CATI) or other communication. 7.

Providing a single question mark \u0026lsquo;?\u0026rsquo; instead of the password will request Survey Solutions to automatically generate one compliant with the above rules. Continuing interviews Some web interviews may be quite lengthy, difficult to fill out in one seating either because of the respondent not being available for so long, or because of the connectivity issues. To continue working on the interview the respondent must open exactly the same URL he/she sees during the interviewing. This URL may be different from the one contained in the originally received invitation. The respondent may copy and preserve the URL from his/her browser\u0026rsquo;s address line at any time. In addition, if the bulk email service is set up by the server administrator, the user will be asked for the contact email at the beginning of the interview. If the email is provided, a message containing the continuation link will be sent to that email. If the server administrator wants to disable this feature, he/she should uncheck the corresponding option in the \u0026lsquo;Web interview settings\u0026rsquo;: Menu → Administration → Settings → Web interview settings.

In other software this may be known under the term \u0026ldquo;text piping\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;answer piping\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;text propagation\u0026rdquo;, etc. The common situations when you may want to use this are: mention an answer collected earlier; display a calculated result; display reference values, etc. For text substitution it is important what may be substituted in, and where a substitution may be used. What may be substituted? You can substitute: variable names associated with questions, to refer to the answer to that question; variable names associated with calculated variables, to refer to the result of the calculation; identifiers associated with a particular roster, to refer to the item title in the roster; some system-defined variables, notably %rostertitle% to refer to the current item name from within a roster. Not all question types are suitable for text substitution. Refer to the corresponding column in this article to determine whether a particular question type is compatible with the text substitution. For single-select categorical questions the substituted value is the option text associated with the current answer, not the numerical value, even though the latter is the value of the question in the syntax expressions (conditions). If the answer to a question has not been given (question disabled, answer was never entered, answer was cleared, etc) or the calculated value was not calculated (variable in a disabled section, exception occurred during calculation, calculation resulted in a null value), then the substitution will insert specifically this: [\u0026hellip;] Where a substitution may occur? You may use text substitution in: text of a question; instruction of a question; validation error/warning message; section, sub-section and roster titles; static text. You specifically may not use text substitution in: option titles of categorical questions; variable labels; syntax expressions of any kind. System-defined variables Survey Solutions permits the use of the following in substitutions: %rostertitle% will substitute in the title associated with the current item in the current roster. This substitution is invalid outside of a roster. %self% will substitute in the value of the current question. The substitution is invalid if used outside of a question context. Examples How old is %respondentname%? Did %rostertitle% work for even one hour in the last seven days? You have told me that the area of your parcel is %parcelarea% acres, which is %calcareaha% in hectares. Is this correct? Hints and notes Check the spelling if you are getting an error [WB0017]. Check the question type for compatibility as described above if you are getting an error [WB0018]. You may not substitute in a question/variable of a roster outside of that roster! \u0026ldquo;How old is %name%\u0026quot; makes sense within the roster where name is being asked, but not outside of it, since there will be multiple people in the roster with different names. You will get error [WB0019] if you try. It is expected, though not required that you are substituting in values that are asked earlier in the flow of the interview. You technically may refer to the value of the question itself in its own question text, though this has no practical sense. You may refer to the value of the question in its own validation message, and this has a lot of practical sense. For example, you can define a check with the following message: \u0026ldquo;Warning! The person is %self% years old, which is possible, but unlikely! Interviewer, confirm with the respondent!\u0026rdquo; If the substitution contains any HTML formatting tags, when they are encountered they will not be applied, but displayed verbatim. Still the substitution obeys the formatting applied directly where it is used. For example, the question text \u0026ldquo;How old is \u0026lt; FONT color=\u0026ldquo;maroon\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;%personname%\u0026lt;/FONT\u0026gt;?\u0026rdquo; may appear as \u0026ldquo;How old is Christina?\u0026rdquo;, where the color is applied due to our specification, and the bold font is used always in all questions (fixed style of Survey Solutions). No recursion: if a text value substituted in contains anything enclosed in %-signs, that fragment does not get substituted. Where you may use substitution, you may use just the substitution. The following question text is technically valid: %qtext%. What question the interviewers (in CAPI) or respondents (in CAWI) will actually see on the screen depends on the value of qtext. Rosters triggered by numeric questions, where source of names is not defined (possible) will have the item index 1, 2, 3, \u0026hellip; substituted in, instead of the the %rostertitle%.","keywords":["substitution","piping"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"January 24, 2020","objectID":"2c61e1c1c63ac1bf38326be58188fa61","section":"Questionnaire Designer","title":"Text substitution","type":"questionnaire-designer","url":"/questionnaire-designer/techniques/text-substitution/","wordcount":745},{"content":" Survey Solutions v20.01 adds the following useful features: Matrix presentation of categorical questions in CAWI surveys; Reusable categories in multiple categorical questions. Matrix presentation of categorical questions (CAWI) Single-select and multi-select categorical questions may now be presented in a more compact form suitable for ranking/matrix questions in CAWI mode. To create this structure the designer should place one (and only one) question into a roster. The categories of this question will determine the columns of the matrix (\u0026lsquo;Poor\u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026lsquo;Very good\u0026rsquo; in the above illustration), while the roster items will determine the rows. Finally the roster mode should be set to Matrix. We\u0026rsquo;ve added this mode to existing Sub-Section, Flat, and Table modes for the presentation of the roster. Despite the shown matrix appearance on the screen, the structure remains a roster with a categorical question in it for the purposes of the syntax writing (e.g. EXPERIENCE[3].Satisfaction) and data export (data collected in this way will end up in a separate file). Number of rows may be fixed (use fixed roster) or be triggered by another question in the questionnaire, for example numeric, multiselect or a text-list. The question in the roster may also be a multiselect: The matrix presentation of the roster is available only in the CAWI mode. In the CAPI mode such a roster will be presented as a roster with sub-sections. Reusable categories This release has brought a long awaited feature of reusable categories: a questionnaire designer may now define a set of categories and use them multiple times across the questionnaire in different single-select and multi-select questions. For example, the same list of all countries in the world could be reused for questions \u0026ldquo;Which countries have you visited?\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;Which country did you visit last?\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;Which country do you plan to go next?\u0026quot;. There are numerous advantages of this approach: Categories are defined once, subsequent reuse is faster for the designer; Any changes in the list immediately affect all questions where these categories are used; The questionnaire becomes more compact (in terms of its size); There is less work for the translator as the translation needs to be supplied only once; etc. To define reusable categories: click the corresponding icon on the toolbar, upload the file with categories (Excel and tab-delimited file formats are supported), assign a name to the set of the categories.

Some combinations or values of these settings may cause errors in operation/synchronization. Change these settings only if you know what you are doing. If you do make any changes compared to the default values, and you are requesting support from the development team, you must mention in your question, issue description, or the support request, which settings you've changed and which values you've specified. Below is a brief description of these settings. The default value is reasonable for most circumstances. If the interviewer is constantly receiving errors when trying to capture the location, this value may be increased to give the GPS-location sensor more time to determine the position of the device. The default value is reasonable for most circumstances. Increasing the value may result in faster, but less accurate measurements of the location. Decreasing the value will cause the device to attempt to determine the position more accurately at the expense of longer wait time and higher chance of an error. Each GPS sensor has its own physical limit of accuracy. Specifying too low of a number here will cause constant or frequent errors in determining the position. The default behavior is to show the captured location on the map if the tablet is online at that time. To save the traffic, this may be switched off and the map will not be rendered in the GPS location question, even when the tablet is online. This does not affect the capturing of the coordinates. The default behavior is to indicate a new error during an interview with vibration (if supported by the device). This can be switched off and vibration will not be used even if supported.

This is especially useful during collaboration when you need to inform the fellow editors that a certain milestone has been reached. Questionnaire import comment at Headquarters When any questionnaire is imported to a data server (Headquarters), whether local or cloud-based, the user performing the import will have an opportunity to leave a descriptive comment. This simplifies later finding which specific revisions of the questionnaire were used for data collection. This comment is shown in the Headquarters (see questionnaire details page) and in the questionnaire history page in the Designer where every questionnaire import is also registered as a separate event.

Device logs Device logs are helpful technical log files, which are useful for troubleshooting of the Interviewer App. Any interviewer experiencing problems (e.g. crashes of the Interviewer App) may submit the device logs through the \u0026lsquo;Diagnostics/Send device logs\u0026rsquo; menu. Only the server administrator may access device logs submitted by interviewers. The \u0026lsquo;Device logs\u0026rsquo; are different from \u0026lsquo;Diagnostics/Collect and send to HQ all tablet information\u0026rsquo;, which actually contains interview data stored on the tablet (in an encrypted form). Device logs will contain the recording of the interviewer actions and any errors/crashes that the program had (possibly over multiple days). Usually the administrator will need to forward this information to the Survey Solutions developers as there is little that he/she can do with the errors at this level. The device logs are text files packed in a zip archive, and can be inspected for privacy/confidentiality before being submitted to the developers. Multiple web interviews may be started from the same assignment link. Earlier versions of Survey Solutions allowed one user to submit one interview from an anonymous assignment link. On the second attempt, either the same interview was opening for continuation (if was not completed yet) or a notification message was issued indicating that the interview was already completed and no further interviews will be accepted. This caused inconvenience to some users. For example, during testing you\u0026rsquo;d want to submit multiple interviews following different scenarios, and a single link would have been a convenience. Furthermore, some surveys may actually require multiple submissions and again, publishing a single link accessible to all respondents is a convenience. The new behavior is thus: if the interview hasn\u0026rsquo;t been finished by the respondent, it will be reopened and the user will continue filling it up. Yet, if an interview was already completed, the user will be presented with a possibility to submit another (new) interview based on the same assignment. Importantly, note that both the old and new behavior recognize the user by a cookie file stored on the user machine, so reopening the link from a different device or from the same device in a different browser, or within the same browser but in private mode will not result in a continuation of an edit session, but in the creation of a new interview.","keywords":["19.11"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"November 19, 2019","objectID":"7f443f81f4426fb334018bc49362d0ec","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 19.11","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-19-11/","wordcount":778},{"content":" Survey Solutions v19.10 adds the following useful features: Assignments history and details page; Assignment comments; Headquarters users may be responsible for assignments; Closing assignments; Multiselect combobox allows for large number of selections; Testing scenarios. Assignments history and details page. Survey Solutions has a strong interviews tracking system, which logs the circulation of the interviews during the data collection and approval process. This has not been previously covering the assignments. Now, the assignments are also covered. By clicking on the assignment number in the assignments list one gets to the assignment details page. The page contains two kinds of information: Historical report on the creation and circulation of the assignment; Detailed assignment information showing the currently effective properties of the assignment. A new system-generated file is available with every export of the data: assignment__actions, which tracks the changes made to assignments. Read more on the format of this file in the following article. Assignment comments A commentary can be left by a person creating an assignment or making a reassignment. This commentary will be visible to an interviewer when he/she receives the assignment. For example: Finish this assignment before Friday! Only the last comment is shown to the interviewer at the assignments page (create new). Headquarters users may be responsible for assignments Headquarters users may now be made responsible for assignments. This is helpful when the sample file needs to be loaded to the headquarters at the time when the workforce has not yet been finalized and it is not clear who will be responsible for which area, how many teams/persons will be involved, and other dimensions of the operation plan. In that case all of the assignments can be made for a headquarters user, who can later redistribute them to supervisors and interviewers. Other headquarters users do see all of the assignments and can take away or reassign assignments made to another headquarters users. Note that administrator user may not be made responsible for assignments (though he/she may make assignments to other headquarters users). Closing assignments A new action has been added for assignments: to close an assignment. For assignments requesting multiple interviews (including infinite) a closing action means resetting the quantity to the amount of the currently delivered interviews. This is a shortcut for a manual change of assignment size to the corresponding number, and it can be undertaken on multiple assignments at a time. This action is only applicable to active assignments and not applicable to archived assignments. Multiselect combobox allows for large number of selections A multiselect categorical question has long been restricted to 200 options. This made sense in the situations where all options were visible on the screen, but was not suitable for some survey situations, when the number of potential choices is large. The introduction of a combobox version of the multiselect question in version 19.04 earlier this year has opened a way to extend the multiselect question to a larger number of categories, since they don\u0026rsquo;t have to be all shown to the interviewers. The typical use of this kind of question is most suitable for, e.g. agricultural surveys, where question like \u0026ldquo;What crops do you grow on this plot?\u0026quot; are common, and imply a large number of possible option categories, yet, typically only a handful of selections. A multiselect question with large number of categories may still trigger a roster, such as to inquire about details of every crop that is being cultivated in the above example. The number of positive selections is still limited to 200 (but can be further restricted to a lower number, as in any multiselect categorical question). Note also, that with a multiselect question asked in a combobox format, the exported data will not be a set of dummies (as for e.g. checkbox version), but a number of variables recording option codes (for first selection, second selection, and so on). Testing scenarios Testing scenarios is a major new feature that we are releasing and plan to continue developing further in the future. Testing scenarios are recordings of the interviewer input that can be applied to an evolving version of the questionnaire to simplify, speed up and standardize testing. Testing scenarios are created in the Survey Solutions Tester (Web Tester or the Tester App) and are saved at the Designer site. Testing questionnaires is time consuming, especially for large and complex ones, with lots of skips or possible filters for options, validations, etc. Scenarios simplify the testing of the questionnaires, especially large ones, where some minimal input is required before the tester can even reach a certain point in the questionnaire. By recording e.g. different family configurations (large, small, with or without children, etc) it becomes more straightforward to test large and complex questionnaires. Scenarios have some limitations, such as binary data or the interview-specific random value may not be stored in a scenario. Read more about testing scenarios in this article.","keywords":["19.10"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"October 1, 2019","objectID":"14d1d6ad1e3212f4c3adb50e819ba722","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 19.10","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-19-10/","wordcount":814},{"content":" Survey Solutions scenarios represent a storage of responses provided during a testing session. The objective is not to collect the data (use Interviewer App for that), but to simplify testing of complex questionnaires which require a certain time-consuming input. Two actions are available for a scenario in the Designer: view: review the answers entered in the scenario; run: start testing and apply the scenario to the questionnaire. Here is what you need to know about scenarios: The scenarios are saved from the WebTester. There can be multiple scenarios for the same questionnaire. A scenario doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to cover all questions in the questionnaire, but may be incomplete, for example, a scenario may cover just the first section or two. A scenario may become no longer applicable. This can be when the changes in the questionnaire were significant (for example question type has changed) and the recorded scenario no longer applies to the new version. In this case an attempt to start a scenario will result in a message \u0026ldquo;Interview data can\u0026rsquo;t be applied to new version of questionnaire. Empty interview created.\u0026rdquo; and lead to a blank questionnaire. Scenarios are not copied when you copy a section or the whole questionnaire into another questionnaire. To edit a scenario, you need to run it first, then make any changes interactively in the WebTester, then save under the same or a different scenario name. One may not edit scenario steps directly, only view. Saving a scenario requires edit permission for accessing the questionnaire. Creation and changes to scenarios are not reflected in the questionnaire history. A scenario may involve input that results in validation errors. This is actually one of the objectives of scenarios, to make sure the validations work! A scenario saves all the steps, how the answers were applied to the questionnaire, not just the resulting final state! This is obvious from the recording of the scenario steps: notice the household size question (*hhsize*) was first answered with value 5, then changed to 3.","keywords":["testing","scenarios"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"September 30, 2019","objectID":"e648dd52e79439839ed5c84ba5daa0a3","section":"Questionnaire Designer","title":"Testing Scenarios","type":"questionnaire-designer","url":"/questionnaire-designer/testing/scenarios/","wordcount":333},{"content":" The Survey Solutions questionnaire can be designed in any language supported in Unicode.

A common use scenario is when a team of interviewers along with the supervisor work in a remote location for a prolonged time and no communication possible to exchange the data with the server. At the same time it is still desirable for the supervisors to control the work of his team. The app allows them to distribute assignments between the interviewers in that area; review and comment the incoming interviews; answer supervisor questions; make a decision to approve or reject the completed interviews; collect and store the interviews completed by all the members of the team, synchronize them with the server in a single synchronization session; distribute the updates of the Interviewer application to the interviewers. Importantly the supervisor app is working with the data stored on the supervisor tablet and does not require internet connectivity for the above functionality. Only synchronization with the server of the supervisor app requires the internet connection. Communications Vertical synchronization: the supervisor tablet must be connected to the WiFi or 3G or similar connection to the Internet to exchange the data with the server. Horizontal synchronization: the tablets rely on the Bluetooth and WiFi-Direct technologies to find each other and exchange the data between themselves. Both are short-range communications, meaning the tablets must be in close proximity (meters away) to each other. During the horizontal synchronization the connection to other networks will be switched off (this may disconnect other applications installed on the tablet from the Internet) and such connection may be reinstated by Android automatically once the Survey Solutions synchronization is completed. Installation The supervisor app has the same hardware and software requirements as the interviewer app, so the same tablets may be used for both interviewers and supervisors. Yet the work load on the supervisor tablet may be larger, and with large amount of assignments/interviews the memory capacity of the tablet becomes critical. To acquire the app the supervisor should: Update google play services to latest version using google instructions While connected, e.g. in the office, start the browser and proceed to the page corresponding to the synchronization point, such as https://demo.mysurvey.solutions. Login into his account with the supervisor credentials. Click on his name in the right corner and select \u0026lsquo;Download supervisor app\u0026rsquo;, wait for the download to complete and start the installation. Confirm the security settings if prompted. Note that the supervisor app will accumulate data from multiple tablets, and will need to also carry the interviewer app to be distributed as updates to the interviewers. Thus the storage space consumed by the supervisor app is bigger than the interviewer app. Have at least 2GB free space when you install it and watch the available space closely as the survey progresses. Initialization After the supervisor app is successfully installed and while still connected to the internet: the supervisor should login with his supervisor credentials; one can utilize the QR-code displayed on the download page to quickly enter the address of the synchronization point; each interviewer in his team should uncheck \u0026lsquo;Allow synchronization with Headquarters\u0026rsquo; in the Interviewer app settings; the supervisor app must be synchronized with the server (vertical synchronization). in the supervisor app activate the synchronization with tablets (horizontal synchronization) in the supervisor app; synchronize all the interviewers tablets with it one by one. After the synchronization of the interviewer tablet with the supervisor tablet is successfully completed, the interviewer has no way of returning back to direct communication with the server. This flag will remain disabled in the Interviewer app settings after the first successful synchronization. Supervisor App Functionality The supervisor app provides the following menu choices: Tasks to assign \u0026ndash; shows the list of assignments received from the HQ that need to be distributed between the interviewers of the team. The assignments are represented as cards with identifying information and the button, after clicking which the supervisor can select the name of the interviewer to complete the assignment. Waiting for your action \u0026ndash; completed interviews received from the interviewers will be shown on this page, each represented by a card with the \u0026lsquo;OPEN\u0026rsquo; button. After reviewing the interview the supervisor can \u0026lsquo;APPROVE\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;REJECT\u0026rsquo; it. Outbox \u0026ndash; shows the page with the list of the assignments/interviews which have been processed by the supervisor and awaiting the synchronization with their recipients. Sent to interviewer \u0026ndash; shows the interviews and assignments that have been already received by the interviewers. Color coding The following colors are used to highlight the sides of the cards in the interface: Gray - for new assignments; Green - for completed interviews received by the supervisor; Red - for completed interviews rejected back to an interviewer; Cyan - for completed interviews approved and awaiting synchronization to the server (HQ). Reviewing interviews Interviews that have been submitted by the interviewers to the supervisor can be found seen at the \u0026lsquo;waiting for your action\u0026rsquo; page. The supervisor can view the interview details in exactly the same presentation as the interviewers see on their tablets. During the review the supervisors may leave comments to any questions and answer supervisor questions. Supervisors can\u0026rsquo;t change other (non-supervisor) questions. The supervisor can open the interview many times and switch between multiple interviews before making a decision on whether to approve or reject an interview. If the supervisor rejects an interview to the interviewer and it\u0026rsquo;s picked up, the supervisor still has access to the interview details and may continue reading the interview information with the understanding that it is potentially being modified at the same time by the interviewer. Commentaries The supervisor app shows all the commentaries in the chronological sequence of how they were left by the users. Bypassing the supervisor A direct assignment by the HQ users to the interviewers is possible even when the interviewer is synchronizing with the supervisor app. In such a case the interviewer receives the assignment after the following","keywords":["supervisor","app"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"September 10, 2020","objectID":"8e674186784f5b0894f9180dff598fc0","section":"Supervisor","title":"Supervisor App","type":"supervisor","url":"/supervisor/supervisor-app/","wordcount":1861},{"content":" three actions are completed in this order: assignment is made by the HQ, supervisor synchronizes, interviewer in question synchronizes. Reassignment Reassignment is possible in the supervisor app. But it is important to coordinate the actions between the original and the new responsible interviewers to avoid duplicate interviewing. Make sure the original interviewer synchronizes after reassignment and before the second interviewer, so that his responsibility is taken off from him before the work starts. Synchronization During vertical synchronization the program is blocked and awaits for the synchronization to complete. During the horizontal synchronization the supervisor app keeps waiting for other tablets to connect, so that multiple interviewers can send data to the same supervisor at the same time. Limitations The first version of the offline supervisor app addresses the most common tasks of our users working in remote areas without coverage. We had to forgo some of the online supervisors' functionality, which may be re-introduced at a later point. For the moment the offline supervisor does not contain any equivalent of the: team display; interviewer profiles and accounts management; supervisor\u0026rsquo;s reports; interview history display; flagging of questions; own account management. Updates The Supervisor App will receive all the updates from the server. We recommend to always update the Supervisor app immediately as the updates are received. The interviewers working with the supervisor will see the updates during synchronization with the supervisor. Receiving updates in this way doesn\u0026rsquo;t consume additional traffic on the 3G network, which supervisor utilizes and all the interviewers can be updated with the same package. For consistency we recommend to update all interviewers at the same time and as soon as possible after the supervisor receives the update. Common use scenarios and ideas We have anticipated that the offline supervisor app would be useful for the following common situations: Distributions of assignments \u0026ndash; the team is working in the remote area without connection and the distribution of the assignments between the interviewers may be done only in the area, hence the interviewers can\u0026rsquo;t travel with the assignments pre-synced to their tablets. Replacements \u0026ndash; the issuance of the replacement assignments in the remote areas where the number of replacements is limited (e.g. 3 replacements for 12 households in EA) and it is not a priori known which interviewers will need replacements. Courrier function \u0026ndash; the supervisor accumulates all completed interviews in his tablet, so that he can travel alone from a remote to the connected area and synchronize all of the completed interviews while the interviewers work on the next batch. Partial synchronization for backup purposes \u0026ndash; the supervisor receives and immediately rejects interviews back to the interviewer, retaining a snapshot of the interview for the cases when the interviewer device is lost, stolen or permanently damaged. In-field review \u0026ndash; when the feedback of the supervisor is critical to continue the interviewing process. For example, to check whether the enterprise was classified correctly as manufacturing enterprise, not services in an enterprise survey, or that the household is classified correctly as eligible for survey, based on the initial screening questions. EA completion \u0026ndash; making sure that all the data is collected and all the issues are resolved before the team leaves the EA. Traffic saving \u0026ndash; utilizing short-range wireless communication for direct transfer between Survey Solutions devices in the remote area. Customers synchronizing over satellite modems save on the satellite data costs because the traffic is not consumed for the reviewing purposes, updates of Survey Solutions interviewer app is downloaded only once per team and other apps installed on the interviewers' tablets are not receiving updates. Control over the traffic \u0026ndash; the whole data traffic to the Internet is happening through the supervisor device, so individual interviewers' tablets do not need access to the internet and can thus achieve better security. Warning: The interviewers that have switched to the synchronization with the supervisor app can not return to the original mode of direct synchronization with the server. For that the whole team needs to finish the work taken offline and synchronize to the server (so that all of their dashboards are empty). After that the applications may be cleared and reinstalled. If the supervisor app is uninstalled or its data cleared using the Android OS, all the data stored in the supervisor tablet will be irrecoverably lost. The same will happen if the supervisor tablet is lost, stolen or destroyed. Synchronize the supervisor tablet to the server whenever the opportunity arises to secure the collected data! Relinking the interviewer tablets working in the synchronization mode with the offline supervisor may lead to undesirable consequences, as the supervisor app knows nothing about the relinking happened on the server. Interviewer tablets synchronizing data through the supervisor app will not receive operating system patches and updates and prolonged work with no updates is undesirable for security reasons. Periodically connect interviewer tablets to Internet when opportunity arises to allow them receive updates for the OS and other installed applications. The Supervisor app is actively developed at the moment.

Headquarters users may respond to Supervisors questions. Detailed user action log can be accessed via API; Export improvements. Comments may be resolved by Supervisors and Headquarters users. A comment may be left for a particular question by an interviewer, or a member of the supervising team (supervisor or an HQ user). The comment usually describes a point of attention or requesting a correction to be made. And when the comment is addressed, it is important to mark it as such. Whenever a comment is present, a supervisor or an HQ user may mark it as resolved by clicking the *RESOLVE* button: Resolving the comment does not erase it completely, but hides it from the screen behind the *SHOW RESOLVED* button. Headquarters users may respond to Supervisors questions. Headquarters users could approve the interviews without waiting for the supervisor decisions. Yet the involvement of the supervisors was necessary in surveys where supervisors questions were included, as the HQ-users didn\u0026rsquo;t have a possibility to fill out those questions. This limitation has been overcome in v19.08 and the HQ-users can now respond to the supervisor questions before approving the interview. This allows creating flatter hierarchies in small surveys, where all the supervisory work is done by the HQ users without the necessity to man the supervisor position. Detailed user action log can be accessed via API. The detailed actions log is useful for monitoring the activity of the users, such as when they synchronize and whether they started working on an assignment. See the support page for more information on the detailed actions log This log was previously only available interactively at the HQ. Now, in v19.08 a new API query has been added to permit a download of such a log (for a particular interviewer) from an external API client. It remains the responsibility of such an API client to parse out the events it is interested in from such a log of time stamped messages. Improvements in Export Improvements in exporting of the data include the more natural behavior of the selectors at the export page, as requested by macuata and other users. Another change fixes a bug where if survey includes more than one version, exporting all of them into a cloud storage overwrote them retaining only the last one, as described by andresarau and others.

This is especially important for operations like population censuses and large national surveys. A web-farm installation is implemented on multiple systems (called nodes) working in concert to service the received requests. Increasing the number of nodes in the farm allows to improve the overall performance: the responsiveness of the system and number of users working simultaneously. The number of nodes in the farm may be dynamically changed (new nodes introduced or existing nodes shut down) without the interruption of work of the other nodes. The overall performance of the web-farm is determined by the performance of individual nodes (higher processing power, memory, and drive speed will positively affect the overall performance). The exact moment when a web-farm must be introduced depends on multiple factors, including the desired responsiveness, number of simultaneous users, performance of the nodes, size and complexity of the questionnaire. Even a very powerful web-farm may still be limited by the bandwidth of the internet connection, which must be taken into account when the Survey Solutions deployment is being planned. Deployment scheme For Web Farm mode Survey Solutions Headquarters should run behing load balancer or reverse proxy with load balancing capabilities.

Yet our vision is coming from the idea set forth by Michael (Misha) Lokshin in 2011 that survey data collection must be accessible, reliable, prompt, and yet yield high quality data. Misha has realized that to make a difference it is not enough to deliver advice and recommendation, but to create a working tool that can extend the accumulated experience to the wider audience of survey practitioners. At first, it was hard to see in the initial clumsy version of our software, humbly blinking the cursor on a single tablet in our office, anything that would be attractive or promising. Yet the idea brought its fruit: today, the software is used around the World in more than 150 countries and not only successfully competes with long established market products, but takes the lead bringing to our users the power of the tools and methods not accessible before. Misha believed that the only way to convince the sceptics is a delivery of the working product, and demonstration of the solution. While setting an ambitious goal of rapid and agile software development Misha has challenged all of us to still maintain the high quality of work that would benefit our users. Misha was building our team, leading by own example of caring of every user and getting into every problem report, often responding to user requests in the middle of the night or while on vacation with his family. Over the years we’ve seen our ups and downs, yet the confidence was always with us that we are making steps in the right direction. As Misha is moving forward to a new phase in his career, we are grateful for his leadership and commit to continue the development and support of the Survey Solutions platform in the principles that he has established.","keywords":null,"lang":"en","lastmod":"June 7, 2019","objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","section":"Survey Solutions | Documentation","title":"Powered by Michael Lokshin","type":"about","url":"/about/","wordcount":319},{"content":" Table presentation of rosters in web interviews Some rosters may be presented in grid form in web interviews (also if the interviewer is using web-interviewer by logging in to the server through the web site, but not on the tablet). The rosters that can be presented in such a form are [for the moment] limited to only the numeric and text question types, with up to the 10 questions, but we intend to improve and extend this functionality to other types of questions and design elements. Read more about tabular presentation of rosters in this article. Notifications for the interviewers The Survey Solutions Interviewer App will now show notifications to the interviewers reminding them on some of the actions recommended at this time. For example, if the interviewer has not synchronized for several days with the server, or if she has not acted on a rejected interview. Some of the notifications are displayed in the Android notifications area, while others are displayed within the application. The administrator of the server can turn on/off the notifications for all the interviewers centrally from the server settings. Read more about interviewers' notifications in this article. Improvements to cascading questions From this version onwards the cascading questions are now: Available for the supervisor\u0026rsquo;s scope (previously limited only to the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s scope). This will allow the supervisors to also take benefit of progressive multi-step selections in large classifications, such as selecting an occupation or an administrative unit. Permit validations at all the levels of cascade (for example, you can construct a questionnaire which would indicate an error or a warning as soon as the branch of occupations \u0026lsquo;professional\u0026rsquo; is selected for the people who are having lowest level of education). Other changes and improvements Keyword \u0026lsquo;self\u0026rsquo; may now be used in the substitutions in error messages simplifying the reference to the current value. For example, the error message could be: \u0026ldquo;Error! The entered value for age %self% is too large!\u0026rdquo;, which may appear for a particular value as \u0026ldquo;Error! The entered value for age 195 is too large!\u0026rdquo;. You can transfer the ownership of a questionnaire that you\u0026rsquo;ve designed to another user, which may be useful in cases when this is your deliverable, or if you are leaving the project and want another user to continue maintaining and developing the questionnaire. Collaborators in the Designer are now presented in the following order: owner of the questionnaire is listed first, then all the other collaborators in the alphabetical order of their emails. During the export of binary data to a cloud storage the user will be notified if there is not enough storage in the destination. At headquarters an indicator has been added to the assignments page to reflect whether the assignment has been already received by the interviewer (similar to the same indicator for the rejected interviews). Questions linked to text lists or to non-nested options are exported in numeric-type columns, rather than string-type columns with numeric content. (already present in version 19.05). Some variables have changed their types in the system generated files. These changes (earlier announced) are highlighted in this article. (!)

Survey Solutions doesn\u0026rsquo;t store the passwords of interviewers in the clear text. So if it is forgotten, no user may look it up inside Survey Solutions, neither the Supervisors, nor the Headquarters, nor the Administrator users. Important: The interviewer may not change his own password himself. This requires cooperation of his supervisor or a headquarters user. The practical sequence of actions is the following: Interviewer realizes he has forgotten the password and can\u0026rsquo;t login to the application. Interviewer contacts the supervisor and asks to assign a new password. Supervisor assigns the new password to the interviewer (in this interviewer\u0026rsquo;s profile). Supervisor communicates the new password to the interviewer. Interviewer enters any text to the password box at the login screen 5 times. After that the system will suggest to login online with the message \u0026ldquo;YOU COULD TRY TO SIGN IN ONLINE IF YOU FORGOT YOUR PASSWORD OR IT WAS RESET\u0026rdquo;. Interviewer enters the newly communicated password and presses the \u0026ldquo;Try to sign in online\u0026rdquo; button. This step requires connection to the server, so the tablet must be online. If the password was entered incorrectly, the interviewer will receive the message \u0026ldquo;AUTHENTICATION PROBLEM ON THE REMOTE SERVER. PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPERVISOR\u0026rdquo;. If the password was entered correctly, the interviewer will be taken to the dashboard. The new password should be utilized from this moment on by this interviewer for all logins. Note: If for any reason the supervisor or the headquarters users change the password of an interviewer while he is logged in, he will not be able to synchronize: once he tries to synchronize a message will pop up requesting him to enter the new password. Caution: All interviewers accounts are made either by headquarters or administrator users. This means that initially the supervisors have no knowledge of their interviewers' passwords. Once an interviewer requests that the supervisor assigns a new password, the supervisor will automatically have the knowledge of that interviewer\u0026rsquo;s password. If this is not desirable, the interviewer should ask the headquarters (or an administrator) to perform the change of the password. When an interviewer requests a new password the supervisor must make sure that he can confirm the identity of the person using other means.

Do not let any other person know your password. Do not rely on another person to communicate the password to you unless this is an established procedure (in other words it is normal that the headquarters users set a password for the interviewers, but it must be communicated directly to the interviewer, not through another interviewer). Logout (sign out) after you finish your work. If you believe your password became known to another person, take immediate action - let the supervisors know that the password is compromised, request for a new password to be assigned to you. If you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten your password, contact your supervisor (or headquarters user) and request for a new password to be assigned to you. Your old password can not be recovered even by these users. Supervisors and headquarters users, when resetting a password of an interviewer, make sure: it is not easily guessed (for example, if all interviewers are issued passwords P1, P2, P3, P4,\u0026hellip; they will eventually figure out the sequence); similarly, never assign all (or some) interviewers the same password as other interviewers already have; When passwords are communicated in writing, take measures to avoid confusion between similarly spelled letters or digits, for example 1 (one) and l (small letter L), or l (small letter L) and I (capital letter i), or O and 0 (capital letter o and digit zero); Survey Solutions doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any of its passwords to be changed with certain periodicity (e.g. quarterly or annually), but it is still considered to be a good practice to periodically refresh the passwords.

Survey Solutions v19.04 brings a number of notable improvements and changes to the CAWI mode that can simplify how large CAWI and mixed mode surveys are administered. Web-assignments \u0026ndash; the assignments are extended to hold the respondent\u0026rsquo;s email and access password; Survey Solutions will interact with one of the several bulk email service providers to send invitations via email directly to the respondents; A system of reminders will notify the respondents that they haven\u0026rsquo;t started or haven\u0026rsquo;t finished their web interviews. Access to the web interviews is now password protected (optionally) providing additional confidentiality protection to the respondent\u0026rsquo;s answers. The Survey Setup page indicates which surveys are currently accepting web responses. As before a survey may accept responses from the internet (CAWI) and from the tablets (CAPI) with aggregation into a single export data file. As before you can create a landing page where all respondents will start interviews and interviews may be finished in several sessions. Multiselect combobox. Multiselect combobox is new compact representation of the multiselect question. It is most useful when the items are numerous (max 200) and lengthy and inconvenient to navigate. For example, the list of political parties, agricultural crops, or other similar items. The selection is done with the help of a combobox control. The interviewer first searches for a category, then posts it to the multiselect question. Each category may be added only once to the selection and will not appear in the search results if it is already posted as a selection. The syntax of expressions and export format is exactly the same as for a regular multiselect question (with checkboxes). Cascading with list of categories. Cascading selection is a useful questionnaire element, which allows selecting an answer category from a large number of choices in a sequence of refinements, selecting from a smaller number of alternatives. It is typically used for selection of an occupation, industry, or another similar selection. Prior to this release, elements of cascading selection were presented as combobox questions, which required the interviewer to start typing the selection before being able to pick it from the list. Now the selection can be made directly from the list, provided that the list of categories is no more than specified by the designer of the questionnaire (max 50). If the number of choices happens to be more than the specified threshold, the control automatically falls back to the old behavior and is presented as a combobox. In other words, the new representation of the cascading question shows lists of items at each level of cascading as a series of single choice questions. New behavior allows more streamlined and intuitive input, especially for the cases where the choices at every step are few, such as moving from 1-digit to 2-digit to 3-digit to 4-digit industry classifications, with a choice from no more than 10 alternatives at every step of the cascade. Other notable changes In exported data files the date and time will be written exactly as the interviewer has seen it when the timestamp question was answered. This has been frequently requested as more intuitive format, rather than the earlier export with adjustment into a single time zone. In exported data files the numbering of items in rosters triggered by numeric questions is starting from zero. For example, if you have a roster employees triggered by a numeric question NumEmployees, it will contain a numeric employees__id variable with the values 0,1,2,\u0026hellip; This is consistent with how Survey Solutions was recording this information for a long time, though recent versions started numbering with 1 for such cases. We have restored the original behavior. The linked questions will contain exactly the ID value of the selected item, regardless what the base for numbering is. The status duration report is now available to the supervisors, not just the HQ users. Some of the Designer compilation error messages are now more verbose about the exact limit and the current value, for example the estimation of total number of roster items in the questionnaire. Thanks to our Uruguayan user Ms. Alicia Ortiz Perez we\u0026rsquo;ve managed to improve the reliability of the data export procedures in cases of local server installations with certain regional settings. Thank you for providing the helpful inputs into this investigation! (!) Version 19.04 is the last version of Survey Solutions that will be compatible with Android OS prior to version 5.0.

The map assignments file is a file, which is uploaded to the Survey Solutions Headquarters to regulate which interviewer has access to which offline maps. The offline maps are used by the interviewers to record answers to the geography type questions. If your survey doesn\u0026rsquo;t use any geography type question you can skip this article. The map assignment file is formatted as a tab delimited file with two columns: map must contain unique map names (must correspond to the files uploaded to the server); users contains the list of the users that have access to the map listed in the first column. When the map must be available to more than one user, separate their logins in the list with a comma. It is normal that a user name is mentioned for more than one map. That user will have access to all of the maps where his name was mentioned and no other. Here is an example of such a file: usermaps.tab. Uploading the map assignments replaces the previous map assignments. If the map was assigned to an interviewer and subsequently a map assignments file was uploaded that doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain this map-user pair, then the previosly pushed map will be removed from the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s tablet at the next maps synchronization. After the map was assigned to an interviewer, that interviewer needs to synchronize his maps (not data!) to receive the map files. These files may be quite large. The headquarters users must plan carefully when preparing the map files and assignments to assign only the necessary maps covering the relevant areas.

All of the billing for this service occurs between you and the corresponding provider, the Survey Solutions developers are not charging you for this service. The configuration of the Bulk Email Service provider occurs at the corresponding page (accessible to the administrator only) of the Survey Solutions Headquarters, which contains service-specific access parameters, and at the management console of the corresponding service. The following parameters must be specified regardless of which service you plan to use for sending out the emails: Sender email address - Email address of the sender that will appear in the FROM field of the incoming messages. Reply address - Email address where the replies from the invitees may be sent (default is the sender email address.)

Here we are specifically interested in utilizing the Simple Email Service from within Survey Solutions for mass email sending. Usage of this service may cost you money. Make sure you understand all charges, limits and policies before utilizing this service. Amazon Simple Email Service is available at the following address: https://aws.amazon.com/ses If you are already an Amazon AWS user, you can login to your Management Console right away. Otherwise you will need to create a new AWS account. A valid credit card is required to create this account. Amazon plans and regulations determine when, how and how much you will be charged for these services. The below instructions are applicable to personal accounts. Your organization may have a corporate or other kind of account with preferential treatment, different billing arrangements, or simplified configuration process. Once a new account is created login to the Management Console. Select Services-\u0026gt;Customer Engagement-\u0026gt;SES. Verify the address that you will be using for sending out the messages. This is done by clicking the link that you receive from the Amazon Web Services no-reply-aws@amazon.com. Next, utilize the Add user wizard to create a new user and assign this user appropriate permissions, group membership and policies. Once the user is created, proceed to Security Credentials and Create Access Key. You will be issued an Access Key and you will obtain the secret as a downloadable file. You have only one chance to preserve this pair (though you can issue another Key+Secret pair later). In the email service provider dialog of the Survey Solutions you will need to enter the three items: Confirmed email address; Access Key; Secret Access Key. If you\u0026rsquo;ve just created your AWS account it is likely in the sandbox mode and it will only permit you to send the notifications to the emails that you yourself have confirmed. To reach real survey respondents you will need to Request Increased Sending Limits, where you submit (to Amazon) the information about your intents. When you fill out this form for region pick specifically \u0026ldquo;Northern Virginia\u0026rdquo;. On the basis of the information you provide you will be assigned various limits on number of emails that may be sent per second, per 24-hour period and per month. Depending on the limit, email requests above those limits may cost more or be disregarded. The approval of the request is not instanteneous, and may take days. Plan your operations accordingly. The above process may sound confusing at first, but numerous tutorials online from Amazon and other sites explain more details of this process.

Additionally it must also be assigned to the whole questionnaire, and may be assigned to sections and subsections. Variable names are used for: referring to questions in the C# syntax expressions; naming the data columns in the export data files; referring to the origin of event in paradata events, errors and comments files. A variable name is a word that consists only of the following: English letters A..Z and a..z; Digits 0..9; an underscore character \u0026ldquo;_\u0026rdquo;. No other characters are permitted in the variable name. Specifically, spaces are not permitted in the variable names, as variable name must be a single word. Variable name may not start with a digit or underscore, and may not end with an underscore. Double underscores are not permitted in variable name. Variable names may not be longer than 32 characters and are required to be shorter for some question types: multiselect, GPS location and some other question types. Variable names are shown in green color in the questionnaire Designer. The following are examples of valid variable names: age, gender, x25, age_of_hh_head. The following are examples of invalid variable names: age_ (ends with an underscore); 0st (starts with a digit); food+nonfood (contains character \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; which is not permitted) In addition to the above restrictions, a variable name may not be a reserved keyword in C#, Stata, SPSS software, or in the Survey Solutions itself, or in OS Microsoft Windows.

Variable names are case-sensitive, once you\u0026rsquo;ve declared a variable Income or SpouseAge keep on writing it the same way in all the syntax expressions. To facilitate export to case-insensitive systems like SPSS, Survey Solutions will not permit you to declare another variable name that differs only by case from one already used, for example it will not permit spouseage once SpouseAge is already declared. This means that all variations of case in the above keywords are also reserved keywords. Naming conventions The following are some common schemes for naming variables in questionnaires: v1, v2, v3 (by question number); s1q1, s1q2, .., s2q1,\u0026hellip;. (by section and question number); a1, a2, \u0026hellip;b1, b2 (by section letter and question number); age, gender, education (by the matter of the question); ageOfHead, numberOfChildren (so called Camel notation); AgeOfHead, NumberOfChildren (capitalization of every variable name); age_of_head, number_of_children (underscores used to separate words). You can pick what is more convenient for your work keeping in mind the following: how easy it is to read expressions involving such variable names; how easy it is to make a mistake when typing a variable name; how easy it will be to introduce a new question in the middle of the questionnaire; compatibility with your file system and data processing package; etc. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve picked a convention for the variable names, it\u0026rsquo;s best to maintain it for the whole questionnaire and inform your collaborators about your preferred pattern of variable names. Note that among Stata users it is conventional to use all lowercase letters for variable names, though this is not a requirement, while in SPSS variable names are not case-sensitive.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"February 19, 2019","objectID":"a09cd059dd101b202bfdb6fc1a03dc0d","section":"Questionnaire Designer","title":"Variable names","type":"questionnaire-designer","url":"/questionnaire-designer/components/variable-names/","wordcount":700},{"content":" Description Audio auditing enables Headquarters to listen in on interviews secretly. Audio auditing automatically records the full interview for selected assignments, stores the recording in encrypted audio files, and synchronizes these audio files along with the linked interview files. How to enable/disable audio auditing Before creating an assignment Navigate to Survey Setup \u0026gt; Questionnaires Click on a questionnaire Click in the box next to Record audio to enable (disable) audio auditing After this point, all created assignments will have audio audit enabled (disabled). To disable (enable) audio auditing, follow the same process to deselect (select) audio auditing for all future assignments. After creating an assignment Navigate to Survey Setup \u0026gt; Assignments Click in the AUDIO RECORDING column to enable (disable) audio auditing for selected assignment This action only affects the selected assignment. How to get and understand audio files To get audio files: Download the binary data for a template Navigate to the AudioAudit folder To understand files, it is important to note that: Each audio file contains the recording of one interview session. These are the same sessions documented in the interview__actions file. A session starts when: either an interview is opened or the tablet wakes up while an interview is open. A session ends when: either the interview is closed or when the tablet goes to sleep. File names indicate content. The file name consists of : the interview__id + audio-audit + the date and time of the interview session. If an interview session is longer than 20 minutes, the audio will be split into files that contain at most 20-minute chunks. For example, if an interview consists of 34 minutes of continuous interviewing, there will be two audio files: one that covers the first 20 minutes; another that covers the next 14 minutes. How audio auditing is enforced on the tablet Just like with GPS or picture questions, Android prompts interviewers to allow Interviewer to use the microphone. Naturally, survey managers could be concerned that intelligent interviewers would either deny Android the needed permissions, or accept the permissions but then subsequently disable them, thereby avoiding audio auditing of their interviews. To prevent this behavior, interviewers will not be able to start interviews that require audio audit without enabling required Android permissions. Similarly, survey managers may be concerned that this request for permissions, made for the first interview that requires audio audit, could tell interviewers that their interview will be recorded, thereby decreasing the utility of secret audio audits. To prevent this, survey managers could explain that these permissions are simply needed by Interviewer application which, after all, has audio questions that do require the type of permissions Android would be requesting. Important considerations Audio recordings will increase the amount of data that needs to be synchronized with the server. For technical reasons, interviews and their audio files must be sent together. The audio files are synced first, and then the interview file. That means the interview file will only be sent once the, potentially quite large, audio files have been sent.","keywords":["audio audit","audit","recording","quality"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"February 4, 2019","objectID":"97035db90a3e23bccc2eee4a27da89ec","section":"Headquarters","title":"Audio audit","type":"headquarters","url":"/headquarters/svymanage/audio-audit/","wordcount":504},{"content":" Section functions (introduced in v19.02) are functions that may be used in Survey Solutions' syntax to get some useful indicators about the completeness of the sections, such as to establish whether a certain section has been fully answered.

Plain-mode roster A plain mode roster is a presentation of the roster without buttons leading to a deeper level, but rather showing all the roster questions repeated in the same scrollable area. This is especially convenient when there are only a handful of questions in the roster, such as price-quantity-unit for many items, and going behind the button and back is very time consuming for the interviewers. We designate the roster to be shown in plain mode simply by checking the corresponding checkbox in the Designer. Read more about plain-mode presentation of rosters in the following article. Dynamic roster limits Dynamic limits on rosters replace the static limits checked at design time in the earlier versions permitting to create more flexible data structures. Survey Solutions provides capabilities for building complex multilevel data structures and at the same time prevents these data structures from exploding uncontrollably. Earlier this has been done at design-time - when the questionnaire was checked during compilation, error [WB0262]:Roster has reached size limit. Reduce roster size or decrease nesting. was sometimes issued, when the structure may have resulted in a large (multiple thousands of) number of items. At design time the actual number of elements was not known, so the Survey Solutions applied the pessimistic strategy of taking maximum values for each trigger. This worked, but resulted in some seemingly valid designs to be banned, notably listing questionnaires where in an enumeration area there could be a large number of small dwellings or a small number of large houses, but never a large number of large houses. The pessimistic strategy deemed that possible. In the new version this check is now applied at run-time during the data entry, and when an attempt is made to overshoot this limit, the corresponding error message is issued to the enumerator and the change in the trigger question is declined. The limit on the total number of items remains the same, but rather the check is moved from inspecting the blank form to the real data being entered by the interviewer. Notably, every questionnaire that compiled in the earlier versions (before this change) will also compile in the new version (after the change), but now you will see more questionnaires compiling and the interviewers should be properly informed/trained as to how to react to this error message. Read more about dynamic roster limits in the following article. Section functions New functions inspecting the completeness of sections have been introduced in the syntax, which return the the number of answered, unanswered and total number of questions in a section: IsSectionAnswered(), EnabledQuestionsCount(), NumberUnansweredQuestions(), EnabledAnsweredQuestionsCount(). The sections and subsections are now also given (optional) variable names. For example, to enable section employment only when the section demogr has been fully answered, we can write its enabling condition as: IsSectionAnswered(demogr) Read more about the section functions in the following article. Improved reporting for multi version questionnaires Reports presented at the Survey Solutions Headquarters are revised to display summaries for the surveys as a whole, with possible break down by versions. This is convenient in case the version revision was technical and the HQ users are interested in the overall progress of the survey, regardless which revision has been applied. For example, the Surveys and Statuses report may present the surveys you are running, such as LFS, LSMS, price survey, etc. with counts of interviews in each status for every one of these surveys. Clicking on the name of the survey will show the corresponding report only for selected survey, but with break down by versions of the questionnaire. Requiring updates Admin user may select to always enforce the current version of the Interviewer App or allow the interviewers to remain on an older version. Some interviewers are reluctant to update the Interviewer App, which causes a chaos in supporting the various versions of the software. The new option allows to enforce updates of the Interviewer App and is available to the administrator user in the server settings. When the checkbox is set, only the current version of the Interviewer App is permitted to synchronize with the server, when it is not set, older versions are tolerated. This option is on by default and reflects our recommendation and best practice. Other changes new page for creating interview: when an interview is created from an assignment, interviewer will be taken to a page indicating the status of this operation; removed some titles from the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s UI; added possibility to unshare the questionnaire shared in read-only mode; comments in the Designer are now available only to users with questionnaire edit permissions; harmonization of reports' appearance: titles, descriptions, versions display. improvements and additions to the Chinese translations.

This can be for example households, persons, plots, crops, etc. The process is completely automatic and not configurable by the user. If you need to combine information from different data levels (for example bring household characteristics to the personal level) you can utilize a statistical package to post-process your data. This is a basic operation supported by most packages, such as SAS, SPSS, Stata, R and others, though the exact terms may differ by package. Note that doing this in spreadsheet applications like Excel introduces unnecessary complications. Here is an example. Suppose we have a survey with interviews corresponding to households and within each household we collect information about the household members. Each household has a categorical attribute region (among other characteristics) and a list of household members (text list type question hhmembers). Suppose further that the main survey level has the ID HOUSEHOLDS and the information about the household members is collected in the roster called MEMBERS. Now, if we were to combine the household and personal information together, we would run a code like the following: version 14.0 clear all cd \u0026quot;C:\\path\\to\\data\\\u0026quot; use \u0026quot;MEMBERS.dta\u0026quot; merge m:1 interview__id using \u0026quot;HOUSEHOLDS.dta\u0026quot; , generate(merge_quality) keepusing(region) tabulate merge_quality assert merge_quality==3 drop merge_quality where all the magic happens in the single merge command and the rest is helping to set the stage for the merge or to control the quality of the merge. Note that: you will need to adjust the path to data as appropriate for the location of the unpacked exported data folder on your computer; this is a many-to-one merge, since there are (potentially) multiple persons in a household; we are merging by matching the cases based on the variable interview__id and in the resulting dataset the level is still that of persons, but now with the household variables (region in our case) attached; in the resulting dataset the cases are identified by the household id variable interview__id and person id within the household variable hhmembers__id, both identifying variables are generated by Survey Solutions automatically; all members of a household will have the same value of the region (and other household level variables); we specified the names of the variable region to bring from the household level, you can omit this option and then Stata brings all the variables from that level. Depending on the analysis that you intend to perform, you may need to merge sequentially several files, for example to bring the household and plot characteristics to the crop level, or make several merges to combine e.g. households with persons and households with livestock, or create other structures. More formally: the merge command in the Stata software is described in the following entry in the Stata manual online; for the SPSS package the equivalent process is described in the following IBM Knowledge Center article; for the SAS software the equivalent process is described in the following SAS documentation page; for the R software refer to the R documentation web page for the merge command.

Each assignment is referring to a particular questionnaire. It is best to not modify the questionnaire during the survey. Some of the undesirable effects of this are: the survey becomes split between several databases, each has to be downloaded separately from Survey Slutions and appended later using external tools; the data may no longer be comparable (e.g. choice sets differ between questions); the data quality may be heterogenious (differing between collected earlier and later periods); interviewers may need retraining for the newer version of the questionnaire; the process of upgrading the questionnaire needs to be followed by upgrading of assignments, which depends on which interviews have been already conducted and which have not. Sometimes this is unavoidable, e.g. in case a gross mistake was made during the questionnaire development and further data collection based on unfixed version doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense. If a new questionnaire is imported, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the existing survey work, since the assignments have been already issued based on the earlier version of the questionnaire. In order for the new version of the questionnaire to be used, new assignments must be created referring to it, and older assignments, which are not fulfilled yet must be cancelled (archived). This may be a tedious process of determining, which part of the survey has been already conducted and which hasn\u0026rsquo;t been fulfilled yet. Survey Solutions tries to help the HQ user by providing a possibility to upgrade the assignments automatically during the import of the new version of the questionnaire template. Here is what it is doing: inspects assignments one after another to determine whether the assignment is still outstanding (not all interviews have been delivered); if the assignment has been fulfilled already fully, nothing happens to it; if the assignment is outstanding Survey Solutions examines whether it can be upgraded to the new version of the questionnaire template; if it can\u0026rsquo;t be upgraded, then nothing happens to it; if it can be upgraded, then a new assignment for the number of outstanding interviews is created based on the new questionnaire template (and all the other fields untouched); original assignment is automatically archived. If the original assignment called for an unlimited number of interviews (size=-1) then the newly created one will also require the same regardless of how many have been already delivered. Note that during the upgrading process some of the assignments may be upgraded while others not. This is dependent on what information is contained in the preloaded fields of the assignment. The number of assignments that have been successfully upgraded is reported at the end of the upgrading process. How does Survey Solutions determine whether the assignment may be upgraded? It looks at the preloading information (e.g. the identifying fields, and other preloaded data) specified in the assignment and checks whether it can fit all of it without any loss to the new questionnaire template. If yes, then the assignment will be considered upgradeable, otherwise not upgradeable. Here are some examples of change between the versions that permit an upgrade of assignments: a new question has been added; the text of an existing question has been changed; a new option has been added to a categorical question; a new validation rule has been added; etc. Here are some examples of changes between the versions that will prevent an upgrade of assignments: preloaded question has been deleted; type of a preloaded question has changed to a more restrictive, e.g. from text to numeric; option category has been removed, which has been mentioned in the preloaded data; etc. What will happen to the interviews that have been completed on the tablets based on old assignments received before the upgrade? When the interviewer received the original assignment and conducted the interview, she usually knows nothing about the intent of the HQ to modify the questionnaire and works disconnected as usual. She may conduct one or more of such interviews as permitted by existing assignments, complete them and synchronize to the server. These interviews will be received by the HQ and displayed in the list of the interviews as completed. The interviews will carry the original assignment number, even if that assignment has since been upgraded and archived. In addition, since at the HQ a new assignment has been created from the original, the interviewer will receive it on the tablet, potentially leading to return to the same respondent. Chances of this will be smaller if the interviewer is notified about the upgrade when it happens and synchronizes immediately to swap the assignment cards. What will happen to the interviews that have been started on the tablets based on the old assignments, but not completed yet? The started interview will remain on the tablet and available to be continued, completed and synchronized. At the same time there will be no assignment card (at the \u0026lsquo;create new\u0026rsquo; page) corresponding to this interview. In particular this means that if the interviewer discards this interview, she will not be able to start it again. What to do? Regardless, it is best to not to update the questionnaire for ongoing surveys. Test your questionnaires extensively using the Tester and online Tester tools and correct all the design errors prior to going to the field. A series of pre-tests/pilots helps minimize the need for modifications of the questionnaire. See more recommendations here. When the modification of the questionnaire is unavoidable, it\u0026rsquo;s best to inform the interviewers about it coming (plan for a particular date), ask them to finish (and synchronize!) interviews that they have started already and not to start new ones. Then update the questionnaire and assignments, then synchronize all the interviewers immediately afterwards.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"December 12, 2018","objectID":"3c7ed2566640c337355c2f07a8577cda","section":"Headquarters","title":"Upgrading assignments","type":"headquarters","url":"/headquarters/preloading/upgrading-assignments/","wordcount":962},{"content":" Support for additional multimedia types in attachments: audio, video, and PDF documents In addition to the images that can be inserted into the questionnaire, the questionnaire authors can now include audio, video and PDF documents as attachments. This opens up a possibility to include various samples of information for the respondent or provide video instructions on how certain actions need to be taken, for example operating complex measurement equipment. One obvious application for the PDF attachment is inclusion of the interviewer’s manual into the questionnaire so it is always a click away when it is needed to double check the definitions. The media attachments are an integral part of the questionnaire and will be synchronized with it all together. If you need to change an attachment you do it in the Designer, which results in a new version of the questionnaire. Be mindful of the size of the multimedia attachments. Each image is adding to the total size of the questionnaire, and videos may cause the questionnaire to become extremely large, meaning downloading them on the tablet will be slower and with unreliable communications more difficult. We recommend individual video attachments to be under 5MB in size, which is a reasonable size for about a 30 seconds video in 1280x720 size and MP4 format. Users of older versions of Android operating system (prior to Android version 5.0) should either update their OS to 5.0 or download an external PDF viewer to be able to view the attached PDF files. Default value for the date question Normally when a date is asked in the date question, the calendar opens at the current date. When this is not desirable, a different default date may be specified. For example, if we know that many people in the survey have applied for benefits in a certain program right at the time when it was started a year ago, we can specify that date as the default. This will reduce the amount of scrolling in the calendar to reach the particular date. Note that this value is a constant and is the same for all the respondents in the survey. Note also that the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; here should be interpreted as the \u0026ldquo;opening\u0026rdquo; date for the calendar input that appears. If the question is left unanswered, the value exported is still going to be a missing, and not the value you specify in the Designer. Hiding all disabled questions Each question in Survey Solutions has a flag which determines whether the question should be present on the screen in disabled state or removed completely when it is not applicable (disabled by the logic). While preferences may differ, if you are a fan of the latter, you may find it a tedious task to go through the questionnaire and make sure all the flags “hide if disabled” are set to achieve this behavior. Now there is a global flag, an attribute of the questionnaire set in its settings, which controls what happens to the disabled questions. When this flag is set, it overrules individual questions’ settings and hides all disabled questions throughout the questionnaire. When the flag is not set, the individual flags are obeyed. Heatmap overlay for map reports A heatmap is a new way of presenting the concentration of observations in the map report at the Headquarters. The earlier presentation (remains available) is relying on clustering of points. In the heatmap, the areas with higher concentration of observations are shown with more red color while the areas of lesser concentration are shown with more green color. Note, that the heatmap fully preserves anonymity of the respondents. These maps could be used to show the progress of surveys without revealing the exact locations of the interviews. Traffic usage New charts are added to the interviewer profile reflecting the use of traffic to measure sent, received and total traffic. This is useful for the clients utilizing the mobile networks for synchronization and want to monitor the usage of traffic by their interviewers. The traffic volume is estimated as total size of data transmitted regardless of the connection mode (WiFi, 3G, etc). The rounding, compression, and other factors on the side of the ISP may cause a difference between this estimate and actual data usage. Client data encryption Survey Solutions development team remains committed to providing our users with a secure and reliable solution for their survey data collection activities. Version 18.12 adds a new layer of defence against unauthorized data access: Now all the data stored in the tablet database will be additionally encrypted with a strong industry-standard algorithm for data encryption, which inhibits data access in case the tablet gets lost or stolen. The newly added defence is completely transparent for authenticated interviewers. Besides the answers to all questions, the multimedia information (audio recordings, photographs) is also encrypted. In addition, the data stored by Survey Solutions on the tablet is saved to the private storage, which is protected by the Android OS from access of other applications. The protection of the data during transmission is achieved by utilizing SSL secure layer for the servers where SSL-certificate is installed (all Survey Solutions personal demo servers requested from https://pds.mysurvey.solutions portal are secured using this mechanism). This protection remains effective and is unaffected by the recent changes. Existing users that update their servers (either themselves on the local servers, or by our technicians for cloud-based servers) will benefit from the encryption automatically. During the update the existing data on the tablets will be encrypted with an automatically generated password (this may take a couple of minutes, be patient). No other actions are required on the side of the interviewers and their work is not affected by the encryption happening automatically.

Hence, the users hosting the local Survey Solutions data servers (synchronization points) should maintain the security in access to those servers. Security specialists contracted for clearing the use of the software by the NSO should direct their inquiries directly to the support email: support@mysurvey.solutions. The particulars of the encryption implementation will not be publicly discussed or presented and may be reinforced in the future by switching to more secure algorithms. Bugfixes and smaller changes Optimization of the points clustering in the HQ map reports for large surveys with tens of thousands data points. Enabling conditions are now shown for sections and sub-sections in the PDF preview. Unification of the calculation of speed report between the HQ and the supervisor. Harmonization of the exported data - variable and value labels added where they were missing, order of variables in the exported data changed, etc. We plan to phase out support for Internet Explorer browser in the future releases of the Survey Solutions software.

Typing in the server address may be time consuming and prone to errors, so to simplify the process Survey Solutions permits entering this information by scanning a barcode. This is especially useful for the ITs setting up a large number of tablets in the office for many interviewers at the start of the survey. Survey Solutions displays two kinds of barcodes. Barcodes of the first kind contain the server address only. These barcodes are displayed on the Interviewer App download page: In the interviewer App we can scan this barcode by clicking on the barcode icon at the login screen: If the Interviewer App has not been installed yet on the tablet, we can quickly navigate to the server page by scanning such a barcode with any qrcode scanner that might be already installed on the tablet. The second kind of barcodes shown by Survey Solutions contains the address of the server and the interviewer account name and is displayed at the interviewer profile page: When this barcode is scanned both server address and the interviewer account name are read in: Survey Solutions never places the account password into the barcode for security reasons. But the Interviewer App will recognize one if it is included along with the synchronization point and user account name in the qrcode. If you want to use this during the setup of the tablets, generate your own qrcode containing a string in the following format: {\u0026quot;Url\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;YourServerAddress\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Login\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;YourAccountName\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Password\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;YourPassword\u0026quot;} for example: {\u0026quot;Url\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;https://demo.mysurvey.solutions\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Login\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;SergiyInt\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Password\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;TestPassword\u0026quot;}","keywords":["interviewer","setup","barcode"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"October 24, 2018","objectID":"7b2991aa29195477bd518238db9cf4a7","section":"Interviewer","title":"Set up an Interviewer tablet by scanning a barcode","type":"interviewer","url":"/interviewer/config/set-up-an-interviewer-tablet-by-scanning-a-barcode/","wordcount":284},{"content":" Version 18.08 of Survey Solutions contains a major, new component: an offline Supervisor App that can be used on Android tablets to provide supervision and quality control while in remote areas and disconnected from the Survey Solutions' data server. We have also made a number of other improvements outlined below. Supervisor App The Supervisor App is an Android application for the supervisors to perform their main responsibilities in the field. A connection to the internet is no longer required for the supervisors to perform the following duties: Distribute assignments between the team members (interviewers); Receive completed interviews from the interviewers; Review information in completed interviews and leave comments; Answer supervisor questions; Approve or reject the submitted interviews; The Supervisor app synchronizes with the main Survey Solutions server (HQ) to receive new assignments and submit completed interviews received from the interviewers when the internet connection is available. This means that a team of interviewers traveling with a supervisor to a location with no internet coverage can be fully autonomous, provided they are travelling with installed and configured Interviewer and Supervisor Apps, and the supervisor has downloaded from the HQ server the assignments for the whole team. That means that the supervisors can review the interviews while disconnected from internet without worrying about the cost or reliability of internet during these reviews. The Supervisor App has the same technical (i.e., hardware and software) requirements as the Interviewer App so that the same tablets may be used by interviewers and supervisors working offline. The communication between the interviewer and the supervisor components while disconnected from internet relied on a combination of a Bluetooth or WiFi connections. A supervisor’s and interviewer\u0026rsquo;s tablets should be within several meters from each other to connect. The Survey Solutions data server does not receive any updates from the Supervisor App when it works disconnected. This has the following implications: Reports shown in the Headquarters are less up to date. They reflect only those interviews collected up until the point when each supervisors synchronizes. Any interview completed after supervisor synchronization will be reflected in reports only after the supervisor syncs again. In earlier versions of Survey Solutions, when the interviews were sent directly to the server, Headquarters’ reports were always up to date. In the current version, there is now some potential for reports to be stale. But frequent supervisor synchronization can help minimize this difference; Supervisor tablets that accumulate completed interviews are the only storage of these interviews and must be especially protected from loss or damage, or else all the unsynchronized data will perish with them. The Offline Supervision is major, new functionality that we are releasing, initially, as experimental. Over the next one to two development sprints, we plan to work on stabilizing and improving this functionality. During that period, we are seeking your feedback, and your help in identifying any issues with Offline Supervisor app. Before using this feature for an important survey survey, we ask that you carefully test its use, confirming that everything works correctly for your intended field protocol, survey equipment, and questionnaire. If you discover any issues, let us know. Should users want to continue using the Survey Solutions’ online supervision mode\u0026ndash; server-based Headquarters, server-based Supervisor, and tablet-based Interviewer\u0026ndash;no additional actions are required. Survey Solutions will continue working the same as before this release. Other changes Interviewers and Supervisors may now review interviews in a flat, compact view. By clicking OVERVIEW, they can see a compact presentation of the interview. The purpose of the flat view representation both on tablets and on HQ is to offer to interviewers and supervisors an alternative and, for some users, more convenient way to review interviews. This feature was requested by Statistical Mauritius and other users. interview__diagnostics file is a special service file, automatically produced with every data export, that contains useful information for assessing the quality of interviews: number of questions left unanswered, number of invalid answers, number of questions with comments, duration of the interview etc. This is especially useful for user-written monitoring systems that work alongside Survey Solutions and continually monitor the quality of incoming data by periodically exporting the data and building customized reports.

That means that this field must be filled for new old questionnaires as well as newly created ones. Questionnaires may now utilize text substitution in instructions. Timestamps in paradata now reflect the local time on the clock of the device where an event was recorded. A new column ‘offset’ was added to reflect the time-zone difference of the device where the event was recorded compared to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Set up an Interviewer tablet by scanning a barcode. Setting up the Interviewer App just got much easier. Previously, set-up required manually inputting three parameters: URL of the server, login of the interviewer, and the password of the interviewer, the first two of which are stored immutably after being entered.

The report presents basic statistics calculated on survey data currently on the server and eliminates (in some cases) the need to export the data for calculation of these statistics. The report is always built within a single survey and is built for one of the questions in that survey. The report may be presented in one of the two modes: tabulation or summary statistics. Summary statistics mode is always applied for the numeric questions, tabulation mode is always applied for categorical (single-select or multi-select questions). For questions of numeric type The report presents the following descriptive statistics in the columns: count, average, sum, minimum, maximum, and percentiles: 5th, 50th and 95th. The rows of the report correspond to teams or individual interviewers (selectable). The values may be restricted by specifying the minimum and maximum. Specifying a minimum of zero is commonly used to exclude the special values in numeric questions, often denoted with -999, -997, or similar values. For questions of categorical type The report presents a frequency tabulation of the selected question by its categories in the columns and teams or individual interviewers (selectable) in the rows. A second categorical question may be specified as a condition question. Then the report may be filtered by categories of this question. For example, the tabulation of occupation may be reported separately for male and for female workers. If a two-way tabulation is of interest, it can be produced by checking the \u0026ldquo;pivot table\u0026rdquo;� checkbox. In this case the second question selected for conditioning will be used as a second dimension of the two-way tabulation. The selection of teams or interviewers is ignored in this case. Totals by rows and columns are included. The report can be downloaded in XLSX, CSV, or TAB delimited format.

The protection applies to reduction, but permits extension. This is commonly needed in the panel surveys, where, for example, the names in the list of household members that are preloaded should not be eliminated by the interviewer, but new household members may be added if needed. The protection applies to questions that may perform the role of triggers: numeric, text list, and multiple-select categorical (in regular or Y/N-mode). Note also, that the answers to the questions may be protected even if they are not triggering any rosters, as long as the type of the question is one of these three. If the answer to the question is protected, then: for numeric question the interviewer may specify an answer greater or equal to the one specified during preloading; for text list question the interviewer may append new items to the end of the text list, but not remove the ones that were preloaded; for multiple-select categorical question the interviewer may select any categories in addition to the ones already selected during preloading, but can\u0026rsquo;t unselect the pre-selected categories. for multiple-select categorical question in Y/N-mode the interviewer may change the selection of options that were preloaded as missing, but can\u0026rsquo;t change their selection if they were preloaded as either positively or negatively selected. The protection of answers may only be done in advanced preloading mode when the identifying information and preloading data are uploaded as a single zip archive. To protect the answers an additional text file with the name protected__variables.tab (mind the double underscores in the file name) must be created and placed into the zip-archive alongside the main data file there. This file has the following structure: the 1st line should contain exactly this word: variable__name, while the 2nd, 3rd and subsequent lines should contain variable names of the questions that need to be protected (each variable on it\u0026rsquo;s own line). For example: variable__name hhmembers n_parcels n_crops The protection applies to the variable specified, regardless of the level where it is positioned in the questionnaire, whether in the main level of the interview, in a roster, or in a nested roster. In the above example, the n_crops variable may be the trigger for the crops roster nested into the parcels roster, and the answers to n_crops specified in any parcel will be protected. If the Survey Solutions identifies a problem with this file, it reports an error and aborts the preloading process. For details, see the following troubleshooting reference. This protection of answers is effective in the whole set of data being preloaded.

Announcement: Survey Solutions VI Virtual User Group Meeting: Thursday, June 14, 2018 9:00 am | Eastern Daylight Time (New York, GMT-04:00) | 1 hr Meeting number (access code): 737 365 639 Meeting password: 9SabPdMH Join the meeting Important notification for self-hosted users: the changes in the Designer are compatibility-breaking so all users of Survey Solutions on the local servers MUST upgrade to the latest version of the Survey Solutions Headquarters application in order to import new questionnaires. For the users of the Survey Solutions servers hosted in the World Bank Cloud the update will be performed by our support staff. Offline GIS Functionality Expansion Question type earlier called area is now renamed to geography and supports capture of various geographic information: area (polygons), paths (polylines), single (point) and multiple (multipoint) on offline maps. Each selection is exported as vectors of points. This question type is now accessible from the syntax to be used in conditional and validation expressions. The following properties can be used in the syntax: double geography.Area double geography.Length int geography.PointsCount In addition, the IsAnswered() function also supports this question type now. For example, we can ask to show the secondary parcel if the primary parcel has been already indicated: IsAnswered(primaryParcel) Or we can indicate an error if the area of the parcel is too small to be a parcel with a dwelling situated on it: self.Area\u0026gt;=30 Or for large parcels we could ask if they are also being used for agricultural purposes: primaryParcel.Area\u0026gt;600 Similarly for the paths we can measure the length and show warnings, for example, when they are unexpectedly large: self.Length\u0026lt;=6000 Offline maps formats have been extended with the raster files, specifically GeoTIFF files that can be produced with a wide range of commercially available and free to use tools. BETA: A single shapefile map can be added to the maps storage on the tablet, and if added in this way will be automatically overlayed on top of the baseline map in offline map. New Headquarters Features Online tabulation report based on the survey data allows creation of tabulation reports (frequency tabulation of categorical variables) with conditioning on values of other variables. For example, one can now tabulate the interview result code by team members to check whether a particular interviewer has abnormally large number of households not found. Upgrade of assignments: Survey Solutions will now assist the Headquarters users in migrating assignments in case of a questionnaire update. When a new version of an existing questionnaire is imported to the server, any unfulfilled assignments in the old version may be migrated to the new version. If the HQ user decides to migrate the assignments, the system will examine them one by one and decide whether the migration is possible and if so, archive the original assignment and recreate a new assignment in the new version of the questionnaire (for the remaining number of interviews still not delivered). We recommend testing the questionnaires extensively to minimize any revisions to the questionnaires during fieldwork. We have simplified the process of preloading to reduce the need for data processing. Specifically, for rosters triggered by text lists, the roster file may include items with any codes (not necessarily in continuous or incremental sequence); for numeric rosters, the numeration of subordinate items in rosters should start with 1 and proceed sequentially until N, N will be saved into the value of the trigger question; In both cases the items will appear in rosters in the order of increasing IDs specified in preloading. These changes help Survey Solutions preload the very same files that it exports and reduces the burden of preparation of data for preloading in panel surveys. [Protection of answers to preloaded questions]/customer/en/portal/articles/2942758) is available in advanced preloading only for questions of type multi-select, numeric and text list. This feature may be most useful for panel surveys where data obtained in the initial visit must be protected, while at the same time it must be extended by new values. A typical scenario is that the list of household members may need to be extended with new household members, while original household members need to be protected from deletion from the list. The Interview report in Headquarters/Supervisor is now more specific about errors in the questionnaire. Previously a flag was raised if the questionnaire contained any errors. This has been indicated to the supervisors in the list of interviews. Now this column reflects the number of questions with errors (n.b. this may be different from the total number of errors) (as per request of Lena Nguyen, World Bank). New API request can be sent to the Survey Solutions data server that returns the interview data for a particular interview in JSON format. Images and other binary resources and comments are not included in this response. Log of actions undertaken on the tablet accessible from the Headquarters. In it the headquarters users can monitor all the actions by the interviewer on a tablet, including actions on interviews that are still not completed. For example: This log is useful in resolving the debates where the interviewer claims that the data was collected, but subsequently \u0026ldquo;disappeared\u0026rdquo;. New online map report for interviewer movement shows historical positions (trajectory) of the interviewer on the map. This report is interviewer-specific and is available on the interviewer profile page. It shows the location of all of the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s interviews in chronological order, along with colors highlighting the current status of each interview: started (blue), completed (green) or rejected (red). Interviewer profile also contains a new warning (red message: “Relinked”) if the interviewer has relinked his/her device. New Interviewer Features Multiple selection questions will disable remaining choices when the maximum number of choices has been selected to indicate to interviewers that no more selections can be made in this question (as requested by Sergiy Radyakin, World Bank).

On the tablet the interviewers can now replay the recording of the audio question by pressing the play button and can zoom to see the photo taken in the image question. Both allow to perform quality control immediately on the tablet and decide whether the audio recordings (photos) are of suitable quality or need to be taken again (requested by Eugene Ehlers, AHRI; Phil Bright, SPC). We have added several new functions to extend our syntax and expanded existing to support more types of data where earlier typecasts were required. We have extended the translations in Chinese and Arabic, and added Romanian language interface for the Interviewer App.","keywords":["18.06"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"June 5, 2018","objectID":"beffa1267b6ecd15d0896a13f46a6a3c","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 18.06","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-18-06/","wordcount":1192},{"content":" Synchronization of the data between the tablet and server is a highly complex process of communication during which a number of actions are undertaken on both ends based on the flow of incoming data. Survey Solutions hides the complexity of it behind a simple Synchronize button available to the interviewer at any time. Normally, when synchronization is completed successfully, the interviewer receives a confirmation message and some summary statistics describing the actions taken (such as number of received assignments or transferred interviews). In some cases synchronization stops with errors. Interviewers should remember that it is always safe to press the synchronization button again to retry. When the errors are caused by interference or noise in communication channel the synchronization is likely to succeed when repeated. if your supervisor has instructed you to synchronize (and this is important in some scenarios) and your synchronization has resulted in errors, then you haven\u0026rsquo;t synchronized. Only when you received a confirmation message that the synchronization has completed successfully, then the synchronization is performed. In countries with less reliable networks the probability of a failed synchronization is higher. It is also higher for longer synchronization sessions, such as ones where a large number of interviews are being synchronized or when the interviews have a large amount of data. Synchronizing frequently helps the whole system running. Synchronization is a process of communication between the tablet and a server, in which the connection is initiated by the tablet, which searches and sends a query to the server. Hence the server must be active and visible at all times when the interviewers might be synchronizing (during all data collection period). The tablet is searching the server by name, known as the synchronization point, which is an URL of the server in the network. This setting is entered once when the Survey Solutions App is installed and logged in for the first time. Normally it doesn\u0026rsquo;t change throughout the data collection, though a possibility to change it exists in the Interviewer app settings. If you are experiencing a repetitive synchronization error after several retries, the simplest action you can do is to navigate to the synchronization point in your browser (typically Chrome on Android devices), for example, https://demo.mysurvey.solutions. The page that opens will usually contain some readable information about the conßnectivity problems. This will help you track down the exact reason for the problem and use the troubleshooting guide below to find a remedy for it.

In short this means that at any moment any interviewer may be utilizing only one device for data collection. Re-linking of the devices is possible, but it has some important consequences (explained here). At the same time it is still possible for multiple interviewers to use the same tablet for data collection, but every interviewer must have a different user account in the Android operating system to permit this. If this is not done, once the first interviewer initializes the connection, his name will be fixed in Survey Solutions, and other interviewers will not be able to log in. Refer to the Android OS documentation for supporting multiple users on the same tablet. When logging in under a different account on the same tablet, the second interviewer will have an opportunity to enter his login/password and connect to the server without a conflict with the first interviewer. WARNING: if an interviewer starts working under one account and later creates a different account on the tablet and still tries to login with the same credentials, this would be equivalent to switching to a new device (re-linking) and will provoke the re-linking warning with the same consequences (described here).

Headquarters Compact presentation of answered categorical questions in interview details view with only selected answers shown in single- and multi-select categorical questions; Old interview details page retained in several previous versions to facilitate transition to the new design is now deprecated; Customize web interview messages, (as requested by Mr. Michael Rahija, FAO) read the article; Export binary data to user-designated cloud data storage, read the article. Supervisor Map report is now available for supervisors, (as requested by Mr. Phil Bright, SPC and other users) covering interviews in their responsibility (report for all interviews remains available to the Headquarters users). Speed report uses active interview time: active interview time is defined as time when the tablet screen is on and an interview is open in the Survey Solutions Interviewer application. This is more relevant for interview duration estimation, over the approach in earlier versions, which based the reports on simple difference between the timestamps at start and finish of the interviews. Interviewer Search on the dashboard (as suggested by Mr. Luqmaan Omar, StatsSA) allows locating the interviews across the various tabs of the Interviewer application. Advanced features and troubleshooting tools Automatic update of the Interviewer application is now default mode on all Survey Solutions servers. The updates are performed automatically by determining only the minimal information that is necessary to be send and the size of the files is typically smaller than 200kb, which makes it possible to receive the critical update for interviewers working even in the most difficult connectivity modes; automatic updates can be disabled by server administrators, though this is not desirable in typical scenarios. Export questionnaires from the Headquarters for the Survey Solutions technical support team in case the original questionnaire has been modified or deleted in the Designer. Capture log of interviews created and deleted on the tablet: the Interviewer application captures what happens to each interview, including those that are created and deleted on the tablet before syncing. In this way, the Headquarters and technical support teams can know what happened on the tablet, and thereby better troubleshoot interview reports of missing interviews. New API endpoints for users utilizing API automation: posting comments to interviews and getting the interview statistics (number of questions answered, unanswered, flagged, valid, invalid, with comments, etc).

Consider, for example, the following validation rules: In this case we are specifying that the wage must be positive, otherwise we should show an error to the interviewer. However, we are less sure about how high the possible wages are, so we will show a warning for the interviewer if it is above 100.0 USD per hour. To achieve this, we set the \u0026ldquo;is warning\u0026rdquo; flag in the Designer for this validation rule (first).

For example, question Q1 may depend on question Q2, which depends on question Q3 and so on, with say, Q100 depending on Q1. The chain of references can be arbitrarily long, but as long as there is a circular reference it will be detected and reported. Another situation is where the question depends on itself, such as with the filtering condition: while the filtering expression may refer to other questions in the questionnaire, it may not refer to the question itself. Circular references are reported as critical errors during the questionnaire compilation stage. As all other compilation errors they must be addressed before other testing tools can be used to test the questionnaire.

It is a good practice to establish a reproducible process of creating assignments (preloading data files) by writing scripts/programs that can be adjusted and re-run to obtain the desired preloading file. Survey Solutions users commonly use various statistical packages, such as Stata, SPSS, R as well as queries to databases to extract the necessary information in exactly the format expected at input by Survey Solutions. This practice allows adjustments be done to those scripts whenever the format of input data for Survey Solutions changes, or if the sample file needs to be replicated for troubleshooting purposes.

With most releases of Survey Solutions, new features are introduced\u0026ndash;new question types, new user interface, new actions, etc. To take advantage of new features, the Interviewer application must be updated. Bug fixes and performance improvements. Each releases of Survey Solutions contains numerous bugs and performance improvements. To avoid bugs and ensure the best performance, the Interviewer application should be updated regularly. Break with backwards compatibility. In general, older versions of the Interviewer application will continue to work with an updated Headquarters server. In some cases relatively rare cases, however, new features break this backwards compatibility. When this happens, the Interviewer application needs to be updated so that the tablet can continue communicating with the server. When to update At a minimum, the Interviewer application should be updated every month. Every two months, typically a new version of Survey Solutions is released. In the intervening time, smaller updates and bug fixes are released. How to know when update are available For Headquarters and Supervisor users, the Teams and Roles \u0026gt; Interviewers tab provides a report of which version of Interviewer each interviewer is using. If application used is old, the cell in the APP VERSION column will appear in red. To navigate there, follow these steps. For Headquarters, click on Teams and Roles, and then select Interviewers. For Supervisor, simply click on Teams and Roles. For Interviewers, the Diagnostics dialog of the Interviewer App provides an easy tool for checking whether a new version of Interviewer is available. The steps for doing so are discussed immediately below. How to update First, select Diagnostics from the Interview application\u0026rsquo;s overflow menu Then, tap on Check for a new version to check whether a newer version of Interviewer exists than the one currently installed on the tablet. If the Interviewer application is up to date, the Check for new version prompt will say so. If a newer version of the Interviewer application is available, tap on the UPDATE button to download and install it. Note: to minimize the amount of data used for this operation, the Interviewer application will fetch the updates only, not the large file that is used for a fresh download of Interviewers. If the process outlined above does not work, or if users need a different mechanism, the Interviewer application can always be downloaded from the Headquarters website and installed.

Descriptive meta information can be added to the questionnaires being designed. 4. New tab “Shared with me” in Designer for shared questionnaires. 5. Enhancements in data export. 6. Objective measurement of time of recalculation of expressions. 7. Other improvements and bugfixes. **The **5th Survey Solutions User Group online meeting took place on 14th February 2018. Online Tester The Survey Solutions Designer now provides an instantly accessible tool to test questionnaires online: the Online Tester. This allows more streamlined testing of the questionnaires without the need to transfer them to the tablet. Among the other advantages is automatic access to the most recent version of the Tester, without the need to update it on the tablet and possibility to utilize the tester functionality for the users that have no access to the Google Play. To start the Online Tester tool, click the Test button located next to the Compile button. Online Tester provides an accurate impression of the questionnaire functioning during the preparation for the web interviews, which don’t utilize the tablets. Users that utilize Online Tester for testing their questionnaires should keep in mind that the performance of the devices (computer and tablet) is different, and in order to have an accurate impression of the performance of the tablet interviews they need to be tested on the actual device (and best on the same model that will be used for the actual data collection). See also the performance measurements for tablet’s response time below. Currently the Online Tester does not show the computed value of variables during testing. Questionnaires that have syntax errors in conditions or other compilation errors can’t be tested. Reassign interviewers between the teams Reassigning an interviewer from one team to another is a useful team management action to bring a team’s size in accordance with it’s workload, eliminate bottlenecks and solve other practical problems. We have added the reassigning as a possible action of the headquarters users in v.5.26 and it can be completed in one of the following two modes: a) interviewer is being moved to another team, taking all the assignments and interviews with him/her; b) interviewer is being moved to another team, passing his/her existing interviews and assignments to the original supervisor. Frequently, the reallocation of the interviewers between the teams is an action taken after e.g. a training or pilot, in which case the interviewers have no assignments and no interviews for which they are responsible. The reassignment at this stage is easy and safe, and there is no difference between the two modes. If the assignments have been made already, one has to decide whether the interviewer is moved with his workload or not. Usually, if the interviewer is reassigned to the team working in a different geographical area, there is no possibility to continue the work started in the original area, and such work is becoming the responsibility of the supervisor. If the new team is working in the same area, the interviewer still might complete the assignments and so may be transferred with his existing workload. If the assignments are conducted during the data collection activities, the reassignment should be done with caution to avoid data loss! If the interviewer is reassigned with a rejected interview, this interview will not be accepted from him when he tries to complete it (since it becomes the responsibility of the supervisor immediately after the reassignment). Questionnaire meta information A new tab in the questionnaire designer now provides access to more than a dozen meta information fields, which can be filled out by the designer to describe the questionnaire (type of survey, covered country(ies), period of survey, responsible organization, etc). We recommend our users provide as much information as possible in these fields to properly classify their composed instruments. The meta information entered here also appears in the PDF preview of the questionnaire for documentation purposes. User Folders: Own and Shared Questionnaires We have added a new tab in the Designer “Questionnaires shared with me” in addition to “My questionnaires” and “Public questionnaires”. All of the questionnaires that are shared with you by your co-authors will be shown there. “My questionnaires” shows only those questionnaires for which you are the owner. Changes to Export of Data The following changes have been introduced to the exported data: During the export to statistical packages Survey Solutions inserts an extended missing value where the answer could have been provided by the interviewer, but wasn’t. Specifically, for SPSS system file format (*.sav), this value is now marked as a missing value. For Stata binary file format (*.dta) this value is replaced with Stata’s extended missing value .a. Both SPSS and Stata will automatically account for missinges in computation of averages, tabulations, and other analyses. There are no extended missing values for tab-delimited export and the user will need to properly account for the special value -999,999,999 in their analyses based on the tab-delimited files. Types of the variables are now more rigidly determined by the questionnaire. You should expect now that even if all content of a string variable is numeric, it should export as string (earlier it could be saved as a numeric column). The API for data export now supports specifying parameters from and to, to restrict the exported data to only the interviews on which any change occurred in the specified window. Time of the Expressions Calculation To be able to get objective measurements of the responsiveness of the questionnaire on a tablet one can activate the execution time measurement in the Tester App’s settings: Show elapsed time per answer. In this mode the Tester app will report the time it took to recalculate all of the expressions as a result of the user providing or changing any answer.

Note that this is only the calculation time, which does not include the time necessary to redraw the screen, so total response time will be larger. Smaller values correspond to faster reactions and better interviewer experience. If you are getting large values, either simplify the conditions (e.g. validations) in the questionnaire, or seek for better hardware. Other changes Improvement in speed of calculations: v5.26 includes a new algorithm to reduce the re-calculation of all the user-written expressions (enabling conditions, validation conditions, etc) to gain performance and to make sure the tablet remains responsive even when working with very complex questionnaires. We have restricted the roster variable name (identifier assigned to roster) to 28 characters long. This is done to make sure that the automatically generated ID (rostername__ID) is a valid variable name (fits into Stata’s 32-characters limit). If your older questionnaire made use of longer roster variable names, you may need to rename them. We improved the presentation of the header of an interview when it is being reviewed by the supervisors/headquarter users. It is now presented in more compact, yet informative way: We have added support of Chinese language in the Designer: The new minimum version of .Net framework for local servers is now .Net 4.7.1. Refer to Microsoft’s web site to acquire the .Net 4.7.1 if you need to update your installation: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime We are about to retire the old presentation of interview details (link: old interview details) that we have retained to smoothen the transition.

In some cases users receive more interviews at the server then the assignment required. This corresponds to values in the column \u0026ldquo;Count\u0026rdquo; are bigger than in the column \u0026ldquo;Size\u0026rdquo; in the table showing assignments. Explanation The reason for this is the following scenario: Supervisor gives assignment A to interviewer X; Interviewer X picks assignment A (synchronizes) and proceeds to the enumeration area; The supervisor changes her mind and re-assigns assignment A to interviewer Y; Interviewer Y picks assignment A (synchronizes) and proceeds to the enumeration area; At this moment both interviewers X and Y have assignment A on their tablet and have the possibility to start an interview from it; note that neither X nor Y know anything about the parallel copy of the assignment, at should normally proceed to fulfill it because it appears on their dashboards. Interviewers X and Y complete their copy of the interview (in any order); Interviewers X and Y send completed interviews to the server (synchronize in any order); At this moment excessive interviews are visible in the server. Recommendations Minimize re-assignments. It is better to give smaller portions of work to interviewers and give more as they complete, rather then give everything and re-assign later. Assignments that interviewers have never received can be safely assigned to any other interviewer. If re-assignment is unavoidable, then before making a re-assignment check if the assignment has been received. If it has been already received by the interviewer X then re-assignment can potentially result in excessive interviews. Make the interviewer X synchronize after step #3 in the above sequence. This will withdraw the assignment A from his dashboard, and when Interviewer Y picks it at step #4 no other copy of the assignment will exist in the system. If synchronization of the Survey Solutions system is not possible (for no network connection in the area reasons), the supervisor must notify the interviewer X using other means not to start the assignment A that he has received and specify the assignment number. This not started assignment A will disappear from his dashboard at the next successful synchronization. Instruct the interviewers to listen to what the respondents are telling them. If they insist that they have already responded to this survey, it may very well be true.","keywords":["duplicate assignments interviews"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"January 26, 2018","objectID":"29f759c8351e2c35361d06a5f0d87e53","section":"FAQ","title":"Excessive interviews","type":"faq","url":"/faq/excessive-interviews/","wordcount":401},{"content":" Note: This issue has been resolved in version 18.12 (23416). Symptoms: When Interviewer app is trying to connect to the Headquarters application on a local server over the secure http (https) protocol synchronization process fails with an error \u0026ldquo;NO CONNECTION TO THE SURVEY SOLUTIONS SUPERVISOR. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THE WEBSITE IS AVAILABLE\u0026rdquo;. The Headquarters application is setup correctly, with a valid security certificate, and in the mobile browser on the Android device users can successfully access it without any errors or warnings. The Headquarters application is hosted on a server running Windows 2016. Explanation: Communication fails due to a bug in one of the external libraries used in Interviewer app. That library breaks when trying to setup a secure connection over http/2 - version 2 of the http protocol. The error doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen on 1.1 version, neither when using unsecured http/2. Starting from Windows 10 desktop and Windows 2016, IIS started supporting (and using by default) http/2 and that is the reason why the users who use this combination secured connection with the application on Windows 2016 encounter the failed communication error. Solution: We are working on introducing changes in our code that would remedy this error and once those changes are out, we will update this article and consider the problem resolved. Meanwhile, workarounds to this problem include: Use Windows 2012. Use http protocol (not recommended for real data-collection but may be a quick solution during initial testing). Disable http/2 in Windows 2016 and use http/1.1 instead. You can disable using http/2 for https connections by adding DWORD value with name EnableHttp2Tls to HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\HTTP\\\\Parameters and setting it to 0. The changes will take effect after server is restarted.

However, sometimes the support team receives inquiries regarding the decrease of performance of the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s app, perhaps after an update. Here it is important to make sure that a valid comparison is made. A few common explanations to consider: � Reason Explanation 1. The questionnaire has changed This is by far the most common reason. The user tests a version of the questionnaire, then sends it to partners for feedback, then incorporates \u0026quot;the finishing touches\u0026quot;: add two checks here, two checks there, two hundred checks over there. By the time all of these changes are made the questionnaire may not even resemble the original version before the pilot. Comparisons are valid provided that the questionnaire is invariant! 2. Different testing scenario. The amount of checks performed by the device is data dependent. If the tests were done for \u0026quot;a family of two\u0026quot; the responsiveness may be very different when you redo it for \u0026quot;a family of twelve\u0026quot;. 3. The tablet could have changed. The user tests the questionnaire using a tablet specifically purchased for the development team. But for the data collection team, a cheaper model questionnaire is purchased. It is expected the hardware will affect the performance. Test the questionnaire performs responsively on the model that you will be using for data collection! 4. The performance affected by 3rd party apps. Check if there are any other apps running on the tablet that may affect the performance. Remember that they may update themselves even without your involvement if application auto update is activated. They may compete for resources with Survey Solutions and decrease the performance. Install only what you need. Uninstall everything you don't. Restrict interviewers' accounts to eliminate possibility of installing unwanted apps. 5. Imperfect measurement. User tested the \u0026quot;speed of the questionnaire\u0026quot; by measuring the total time it takes to enter some values. In the field the time became longer. This can be due to any of the reasons related to the real communication between two people (need to repeat questions, revise earlier answers, think about what is being asked, what are the answers, how to record them into the questionnaire, etc) compared to a rehearsed procedure of entering a specific test example. 6. Comparing apples with oranges. \u0026quot;The questionnaire used to work faster before! Yes, before it was not in Survey Solutions, and not on an Android tablet, but on a Windows server, and we didn't have any validation checks or calculated expressions, but it was faster\u0026quot;. No comment. 7. Wishful thinking. No objective measurement was taken to measure the performance of the questionnaire during testing, then when the survey started and things start to matter, the questionnaire performance is deemed inadequate. Test during preparation. Survey Solutions has very flexible and powerful language and multiple strategies for questionnaire implementation. Copying paper questionnaires is usually a common mistake that leads to inefficient questionnaires and inadequate responsiveness. A second opinion of a reviewer helps identify these inefficiencies and get an advice on how to improve the questionnaire.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"December 13, 2017","objectID":"bc5111aa920c0994157d18967fe89ea9","section":"FAQ","title":"My questionnaire is not as fast as it used to be.

To make data management easier, ID variables have been harmonized across all export files. To make survey management more powerful, new data files now exist to analyze data collection devices and interview errors. Folders on Designer. To better organize public questionnaires for user learning, sharing of resources, and development and dissemination of standards. Managing and distributing maps. New tools for headquarters to manage maps and distribute them wirelessly to interviewers. Admin auditing log. Record of all the main actions on the server, identifying who made the action, and when. Examples include: importing a questionnaire on the server, initiating data, deleting a questionnaire, etc. While new features typically do not interfere with old features, sometimes there are exceptions. With this release, there are two such features: New interview details interface. By default, the new interface will be shown. If users are not ready for the new design, they may revert to the old design for now. New naming scheme for ID variables. Because Survey Solutions expects the same type of files it produces, the changes is the names of variables names need to be taken into account by users uploading interview assignments. Coming is another such feature. To make significant improvements to responsiveness of the Interviewer’s user interface, especially for large questionnaires (i.e., 800+ questions), we will be releasing an update. In mid-December, we will be releasing this as a hotfix to the current version, 5.25. To receive this hotfix, users need to write our support team. In early February, we will be releasing this code as part of the new version, 5.26. At that point, the update will be automatically sent to all servers. Whenever this update is received, users will need to update their tablets so their updated servers can talk to tablets with updated software. New Interview details interface To make reviewing interviews easier, the interview details view—that is, the view Headquarters and Supervisors have of the full interview—has been substantially improved in two ways. First, the user interface has been redesigned to match that of the Interviewer application. To make navigation intuitive, the interview details view now has the same navigation pane as the Interviewer application. Sections of the questionnaire listed on the left. Colors indicate completion status of sections. And sections may be expanded to navigate directly to sub-sections and roster rows. To make interview content clear, the interview details view renders questions and their answers just like the Interviewer application. In that way, Headquarters and Supervisors users see what Interviewer users do. More than mere aesthetics, this change reduces the training needed for Headquarters and Supervisors to review interviews, since the user interface is essentially the same as on the tablet. Second, the user interface has been made more powerful by the introduction of filters. In the left-most pane, Headquarters and Supervisor users may filter interviews in order to focus on content of interest by ticking on the corresponding box(es) (e.g., supervisor questions, flagged questions that are also invalid, etc.). When used, filters query the questionnaire for questions of interest, and yield a list of results in the middle pane. Clicking on a result has the effect of moving to that result and its context in the questionnaire. Have a survey in the field right now? Inform field teams of the change, and help them make the transition from the old interface to the new one. Not ready for the update? No problem. The old interface can still be used for the next few months. To revert to the old design, click on Old interview details at the bottom of the left-most pane. Complete localization of user interface Previously, most parts of Survey Solutions were localized to other languages. But there were a few gaps. Designer was not localized. For some previously localized software components, like Headquarters, recent development outpaced translation. Now, every component of Survey Solutions speaks your language. With version 5.25, all text in all software components—that is, in Designer, Tester, Headquarters, Supervisor, and Interviewer—have been translated. For the moment, the full interface has been translated for the following languages: French Russian Spanish In future releases, there are plans to translate the interface fully into these languages as well: Arabic Chinese (A small technical note: for web-based software components, the interface language follows web browser’s language; for tablet-based software components, the interface language follows the device language.) Improvements to multi-language questionnaires Beyond localization, version 5.25 has made two more steps towards making Survey Solutions even more multi-lingual friendly: Set default language in Interviewer Previously, the multi-language features took the language the language of a questionnaire’s design—that is, the language used to develop a questionnaire in Designer—as the main language, and languages as translations. Now, the questionnaire designer can select the default language of administration—that is, the language version that is shown when an interview is opened in Interviewer. To mark a language as the default, open the translations pane in Designer, hover over a translation, and click on MARK AS DEFAULT LANGUAGE. To keep the language of design as the default language, no action is required. Export PDF version of questionnaire into any questionnaire language Previously, Designer produced a PDF version of the questionnaire only in the language of the questionnaire’s design. Now, users may select the export language for the PDF file form a drop-down menu of translations defined","keywords":["5.25"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"December 6, 2017","objectID":"952ffd007f6b711d785747b809e1512a","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 5.25","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-5-25/","wordcount":2395},{"content":" for that questionnaire. To do this, export the PDF as usual, select a language from the drop-down menu of translations, and click on GENERATE PDF to download the file. Folders on Designer Up until now, questionnaires have been a searchable list of documents. With version 5.25, folders will be introduced for public questionnaires. This is an exciting development, for several reasons. First, it organizes questionnaires into thematic groups (e.g., questionnaires from YouTube videos, questionnaires for learning features, examples of questionnaires deployed by users). Second, and perhaps more exciting, is that folders will allow the Survey Solutions community to share resources and establish standards. Examples include national or international classification systems (e.g., ISIC, ISCO, COICOP, etc.); questionnaires that reflect regional or international standards (e.g., WAEMU’s Harmonized Household Living Standards Survey, OECS’ Labor Force Survey, FAO’s Forestry Module, etc.); and questionnaires that showcase features and common or complex validations (e.g., checking that the household head and son/daughter have an appropriate age differential, lookup tables to evaluate unit prices, etc.). But these are simply examples. To make this content most useful, we ask our users to write us with ideas and with content to share. To do so, please write to us. In future releases, folders may be expanded to help users with file management. In the near future, all users will have a Shared with me folder that captures all questionnaires developed by other but shared with users. Export files improved Version 5.25 contains several improvements to export data files. (Note: users with code that creates assignment files will need to update that code to ensure that those files contain the new variable names Survey Solutions now expects.) Identifiers have fixed, descriptive names Data files have been revised in two ways. First, identifiers have the same name in every file in which they appear. The household identifier, for example, has the same name in all files that contain it. Second, identifiers take on the name of object they identify. If the household member roster is called hhroster, for example, then its identifier is named hhroster__id. The new naming scheme is as follows. The main case identifier is interview__id. The case identifier for roster rows is the roster variable name plus __id– for example, a roster with the roster variable name agParcels would have a roster row identifier named agParcels__id. Case identifiers appear in all files To facilitate merging, the following case identifiers appears in every export file: interview__id interview__key The variable interview__id corresponds to the 32-character system-generated identifier previously captured in Id in the main data file. The variable interview__key corresponds to the short, more user-friendly identifier for tracking interviews in Headquarters, Supervisor, or Interviewer applications. Interview attributes exported to the main data files Previously, the status of surveys and their data have been separate entities. To see status, one needed to consult interview reports (or find a case in the interview_actions export file). To analyze data, one needed to export data. Now, the export files contain two variables that provide a useful bridge between survey management and data analysis. In the main data export file, users will find the following variables: interview__status has__errors The interview__status variable corresponds to the status in the survey management system (e.g., Completed, ApprovedBySupervisor, etc.). The variable has_errors captures whether the interview contains any validation errors—1 if so; 0 otherwise. New export files With version 5.25, we have continued implementing the following data policy: if Survey Solutions captures or displays it, Survey Solutions should also export it. That way, users can use all the rich data we capture, and conduct analyses that go beyond what the current user interface allows. With that in mind, two new data files are now available for export: Interviewer/device information Interview errors Interviewer/device information Previously, Survey Solutions collected summary information on interviewers, and detailed data on the devices they use (e.g., Android OS version, battery power, speed of connection on last sync, etc.). The interviewer information was available on Teams and Roles \u0026gt; Interviewers. The detailed device and sync data could be seen on that interviewer’s profile page. Now, Survey Solutions combines those two reports into a single, exportable one. To export that report, navigate to Teams and Roles \u0026gt; Interviewers, scroll to the bottom of the screen, and click the desired file format. Note: creation of the export file may take some time when there are a large number of interviewers, since the export file is constructed from interviewer attributes and the details of the device’s last known status. Interview errors Previously, validation errors were visible in a few ways. First, users could see them upon manual review of interviews. Second, advanced users could see them in the paradata. Now, the interview__errors contains a compilation of all validation errors. Following the structure of the interview_comments file, the interview__errors allows the user to link validation errors back to a particular validation for a particular question (in a particular roster row) in a particular interview. To allow this linking, the file contains the following information: variable. The name of the object to which the validation error is linked. type. The type of object to which the validation error is linked: 1=Roster, 2=Question, 3=StaticText, 4=Variable. roster. If the error occurs outside of a roster, this column will be blank. If the error occurs in the roster, the column will contain the roster variable name for the roster where the error occurs. interview__id. The identifier of the interview. id1. The identifier of the top-level roster instance. The value communicates both the name of the roster and the row. If the roster is named myRoster, then the value for row two is myRoster__id[2]. id2. The identifier for the second-level roster instance. id3. The identifier for the third-level roster instance. message_number. The validation error number in Designer. message. The string error message (without text substitution) that is displayed. This data could aid survey manager is in identifying the most frequent validation errors, overall and/or by team.

This process for map distribution, to say the least, is tedious and error prone. Now, Survey Solutions allows survey managers and interviewers alike a user-friendly for map management—for assigning maps to interviewers and for downloading maps to tablets, respectively. Assign maps to interviewers Map assignments, like all other assignments made on Headquarters, are part of survey setup. To make assignments, follow these simple steps: First, log into Headquarters. Then, upload maps to the server. Click on UPLOAD .ZIP FILE. Select a zip archive containing one or more maps. Next, assign maps to users. Click on the Update user-to-map linking. Upload a tab-delimited file that assigns one or more maps to users. For any given map, the survey manager may preview the map on Headquarters, and see the users to whom it is assigned Receive maps on tablets Map assignments, like all other interviewer assignments, must be downloaded via synchronization. Because map assignments are special (and may contain very large files), their synchronization has a special screen and special process that is separate from typical synchronization. To download assigned maps, follow these steps: Open the Interviewer application Navigate to the map synchronization screen. From the Interviewer dashboard, tap on the overflow menu. Then, select maps. From the maps screen, tap on the sync button. Wait for maps to download. Because map files may be quite large, it is strongly advised that map synchronization be done in the head office before deployment to the field. Other improvements In addition to the big-ticket items above, version 5.25 contains several Answers to area questions—that is, the map and user-sketched boundary—can be seen on web interview and interview details. Interview_actions contain two new actions: paused and resumed. These actions allow survey managers to compute more precise estimates of interview duration. The paused action occurs when an interview is closed or the tablet goes to sleep (or after 15 minute timeout for web interview). The resumed action occurs when an interview is reopened or the tablet wakes up (or when the page is reloaded for web interview). Duration reports in Headquarters do not yet use these actions for improved interview duration estimates.

This is the first user account created after Survey Solutions is installed, typically by the same person who performed the installation. Administrator is a privileged account and can do important actions which may result in damage to data. Assign a responsible and informed person as an administrator! We recommend that the administrator has attended a comprehensive Survey Solutions training. An administrator can do (almost) everything an HQ user can do plus some exclusive actions: create HQ user accounts, observer user accounts and API user accounts (in addition to supervisors and interviewers as an HQ user can do), change passwords for these users; set up a logo for the server and the tablets; leave a message for all of the HQ users and supervisors; password-protect downloadable data; delete a survey (questionnaire and all data); unarchive a user; inspect the server audit log. Note that a server administrator may not be designated responsible for assignments, while a headquarters user may be. An administrator of the Survey Solutions data server must be familiar with the following procedures: Actions before the survey starts If the password has been received via email, log in and change the password: make sure you select a strong password! do not share the administrator password with anyone; do not forget the administrator password and store securely with important records, (but not in an open/visible place!); do not mention the administrator password in emails; do not use administrator account for day-to-day HQ operations. See more recommendations in the Password Best Practices. It is recommended to turn on the two factor authentication (2FA) for the administrator account. Check the admin server settings, adjust the logo, global message, bulk email providers, and other parameters as necessary. Create accounts for one or more headquarter users (including one for yourself). Log out from the administrator account. For your own safety do not use administrative account for day-to-day operations. Use administrative account exclusively to perform the tasks that HQ users can’t perform, such as adjusting the server\u0026rsquo;s admin settings or deleting a survey. Do communicate the credentials for the accounts you create on your server with the corresponding users (supervisors, interviewers, etc). These users do not receive their credentials per email, even if an email is specified at the time the user account is created. Actions during the survey Monitor the functioning of the server. Analyze any crashes, faults, overloads or abnormal behavior. Address user requests, such as password reset for HQ users, and other tasks that can\u0026rsquo;t be performed by HQs. Collect and analyze user problem reports. Attempt to address them to the extent possible. Refer the users to the corresponding sections of the manuals. Elevate the problems requiring developers' attention to support. Preserve the copies of the uploaded sample files and split-key files. Periodically download, back up, and securely store the export data. Promptly respond to the notifications of the network administrator. Monitor the progress of the survey. Monitor and install the updates to the Survey Solutions software. Monitor and install updates to other software and OS installed on the server to maintain safe and secure environment. Actions after the end of the survey At the end of your survey you need to secure the collected data, to avoid it being irreversibly lost. Instruct the interviewers to stop conducting interviews, mark them as completed. Synchronize all the interviews data from the tablets to the server. Make sure that the synchronizations complete successfully. (If a synchronization is finished with an error, the server may not have received the data from the tablet!) Do the final approvals/rejections of the submitted interviews. In HQ proceed to the data export screen. Download ALL data in all formats (tab-delimited and Stata and SPSS). Download data even in formats which you don\u0026rsquo;t immediately plan to use. Repeat for every version of the questionnaire (if the questionnaire was ever updated on the server). Repeat for other statuses (approved by headquarter, etc) as necessary. If you collected any multimedia data (images, audio,..) you need to download the binary files too. This can often be a lengthy download. Count the files and make sure you have downloaded all of them. Test every downloaded archive to make sure there is no data transfer error. Open every archive and visually inspect downloaded files. Do not delete the survey from the server if you notice any irregularities in the downloaded data. Store your downloads on a secure media Immediately make a secondary backup copy of the downloads, preferably on a non-eraseable media (CD/DVD). Clearly mark each backup copy. Indicate the user who created the backup, date, survey name, and other information. If you are uploading your backup to the file storage create an accompanying readme file. Do not transform, convert, or otherwise process the data downloaded from Survey Solutions server before securing the downloaded files. Review and save/print any reports you may need from the server. Reports are not part of data export. Only delete a survey or dispose of the server once you complete all the procedures in this list.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"January 20, 2021","objectID":"dd24c39eb0aef2adeee8b274584dc041","section":"Headquarters","title":"Survey Solutions Server Administrator","type":"headquarters","url":"/headquarters/accounts/survey-solutions-server-administrator/","wordcount":843},{"content":" Calculated variables are commonly used in CAPI questionnaires to implement complex checks or indicate to the interviewer some derived information.

Cases to be reassigned to another interviewer You may need to change survey case assignments because of interviewer job performance issues, illness, and management of the team’s workload. For example, reassigning a survey case from an overloaded interviewer to an interviewer that has time. The protocol for changing assignments vary depending on the interview status. There are three possible scenarios: To change the allocation of assignments that have not yet been synchronized with interviewer’s tablets, do so under the assignments tab. To change the allocation of assignments that have been synchronized with interviewer’s tablets, follow the steps outlined in the Distributing Assignments article. You will then be prompted to confirm the change in assignments. Note that any data collected for these cases by the former interviewer will be lost. To change assignments of completed interviews, select the interviews you want to reassign by clicking the checkbox. Reject these interviews by pressing Reject button on the toolbar, then reassign the interviews to another interviewer. To reassign the case, select the check box to the left of the survey case(s), then click on Assign and select an Interviewer from the pop-up menu. Another similar scenario where this protocol can be applied is when the first interviewer has opened a number of assignments and needs the second interviewer to finish them, he/she should mark them as completed (even they are only partially filled out) and let the supervisor know to reject them to the second interviewer. In that case the data already collected to date will flow over to the second interviewer.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"September 20, 2017","objectID":"09134bb292e23c227ec8770159d19ac4","section":"Supervisor","title":"Reassign an Interview","type":"supervisor","url":"/supervisor/reassign-an-interview/","wordcount":283},{"content":" Switch to the list of the assignments to the team by clicking on the Assignmentsmenu item at the top of the screen**. **Set the check box to the left of the assignment(s) to be assigned to an interviewer.

By seeing how many days interviews stay in the same status, survey managers can see whether survey operations are moving forward, and identify any bottlenecks (e.g., slow approval by supervisors, slower reactions by HQ, etc.) .By clicking on any cell in the report, managers can drill down to the details of which questionnaires and/or field staff are behind interviews stagnating in the same status. Devices/Interviewers Troubleshooting can be hard. To make this difficult task somewhat easier, the Devices/Interviewers report compiles information on potential problems—failures to sync with the server (NEVER CONNECTED), oversights in updating Interviewer (OLD VERSION), and problems in tablet settings (WRONG TIME ON TABLET), etc.. From this report on all interviewers, survey (IT) managers can easily navigate, with a click, to more detailed reports on an individual interviewer’s sync history and tablet info. Facility for exporting reports to XLS, CSV, and TAB formats Even if you have moved to CAPI, your bosses or clients may still want paper reports. To make traditional reporting easier, all tables on the Reports tab can now be exported to XLSX, CSV, or TAB format. From that format, you can easily include them in status updates to internal and external clients. To export, navigate to the bottom right of the report, and click on the desired download format. Overall improvements All reports have been given a modern look and feel. Column headers can be clicked to sort most reports. Rows, thanks to alternating dark and light lines, are easier to read. Most reports have headers with totals, making management of surveys with several survey instruments easier. Many reports have more straightforward controls. All filters have clearer names. Some filters, like those for the Quantity and Speed reports, have been organized in a more intuitive order. Other improvements Improved interface for the Interviews tab in Headquarters/Supervisor More than a simple makeover, the improvements to the Interviews tab are more functional than aesthetic. First, Interviews have a new action menu. Upon (left-) clicking on any interview, the Headquarters or Supervisor user will see a menu of actions available. Second, some of the menu actions are new actions. The Show Status History option shows a status report for the selected interview in clear, compact format—showing what status change occurred (STATE), when it happened (CHANGED ON), who initiated the change (BY), who picked up the interview (ASSIGNED TO) , and some optional notes on why the change occurred (COMMENTS). The Open responsible’s profile option takes the user to a detailed report on the interviewer’s recent synchronization activity, connection statistics, and detailed device info. Other assorted improvements These include: Localization of the web interview user interface into French, Spanish, and Arabic. This will allow those who complete questionnaires online the same ease of navigation that interviewers have on the tablet. Stay tuned for more localization. Interview key exported. In version 5.20, the interview key—a short, unique interview identifier—appeared in Headquarters and Supervisor. In this version, that key is being exported along with other survey data. In another version very soon, the interview key will be visible to interviewers as well. This will allow all quick identification of survey cases, avoiding vague references to the household head’s name or overly precise provision of all identifying information. Performance improvements and bug fixes. In addition to the visible features are continued improvements to the performance of all components of Survey Solutions.","keywords":["5.23"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"September 1, 2017","objectID":"cb824c2eebc3fb1b3a4f260f808ee912","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 5.23","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-5-23/","wordcount":646},{"content":" In Survey Solutions v5.22 we have added access to server by interviewers, a new question type (audio) and various other improvements. Audio question The new audio question type has been added following the overwhelming number of requests from our users, especially dealing with surveys in literacy, education, and public opinion research. In these surveys the recording of the respondent’s voice may serve quality control purposes or be directly of interest to the researchers. Audio question allows recording sound (voice) of the respondent as part of the interview using the tablet’s microphone. The recorded data is then transferred to the server and exported as part of the binary data export. An audio question doesn’t have any custom properties and can be added in Designer by specifying an appropriate question type, text, variable name and other common properties: An optional instruction may indicate how the interaction between an interviewer and the respondent should proceed. As any other question, audio question may be asked or skipped based on the internal logic of the questionnaire, which is fully under control of the questionnaire designer. Audio questions may only have one scope: interviewer. On a tablet the audio question is represented similarly to an image type question, with the button which needs to be tapped to start recording: During the recording, a timer and recording status are displayed. If necessary, the recording can be deleted, and a new recording be made instead. Note that the audio recording is activated by the interviewer, it is a conscious action (commonly the consent of the respondent is also to be obtained). An audio question can also be used in web interviews. Note that an audio question has a 180 seconds limit on recording duration, and if the recording is not cancelled at that time it will be saved automatically replacing the previous answer for this question. For web interviews the compression is performed on the server. All audio data is saved in the AAC (advanced audio encoding) format into *.m4a files. Interviewer sign in to Survey Solutions In this version we have expanded the Survey Solutions server functionality, which now allows interviewers to sign in using the same credentials as on the tablet. Once signed in, the interviewers have access to their: Assignments; interviews (started, completed and rejected); Profile (counts of interviews and device description and status). When an assignment has been made to the interviewer, he can pull it out to the tablet (just clicking the synchronization button), or start it as a web-interview and complete it online. Interviews started online, may be completed online or on the tablet after synchronization, but interviews received on the tablet must be completed on the tablet. Other changes and improvements Single-select cascading questions may now also use validation conditions; Comments are now supported in web interviews and can be accessed from the question’s menu; Interview key is now displayed throughout the whole system, including the tablet after the interview has been opened; Images taken with the tablet’s camera are automatically proportionately resized to have longer side no longer than 1024 pixels; Language-switch icon was added to web interviews to signal the nature of the selection to international users.","keywords":["5.22"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"August 3, 2017","objectID":"8b86a716d3ae6b7376aa89f6a4af60d7","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 5.22","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-5-22/","wordcount":528},{"content":" Survey Solutions is an actively developed software.

The minimal requirements represent the specifications for the oldest tablets that can run Survey Solutions. We advise to procure newest devices with the latest version of Android for the projects that expect to run for two or three years. Please refer to google.com for the information on the latest version of Android OS and for the list of devices supporting this latest version. 1. Server Contact support for a consultation prior to setup if your survey is 100,000 interviews or more, or if you are collecting any multimedia data. 1. What are the requirements for the server? Server requirements are periodically revised as the Survey Solutions program evolves hence we've created the following pages on: server requirements server installation 2. Is it possible to use our existing server for Survey Solutions? It depends: If the hardware requirements are met, and the software prerequisites are available, there might be a possibility to reuse the existing server. Note that in that case existing services will compete with Survey Solutions for resources. So this solution is possible only with a very powerful server, or non-demanding other services. The maintenance of the other software should not affect availability, integrity and security of Survey Solutions service. 3. How do we configure our security software to collaborate with Survey Solutions? Firewalls, anti-virus, and integrated security packages need to be configured to permit Survey Solutions server component to communicate with other devices exchanging data with it. Consult your security software manual and network administrator for specific instructions. Instructions for Windows Server 2012 Firewall Examples for configuring other common security software: Avast Internet Security Comodo Internet Security Kaspersky Internet Security McAfee Internet Security Norton Internet Security ZoneAlarm Pro Firewall Other internet security packages may have similar configuration settings to allow a program access to network resources. 4. We have necessary server equipment, but no specialists to install the Survey Solutions software. Is it possible to get help? If you encounter any difficulties in setting up your server, please inquire in the [forum of the Survey Solutions community of users](https://forum.mysurvey.solutions). 5. We don’t have a proper server. Is a server necessary for Survey Solutions, or can we use the software with the tablets only? A server provides essential functionality and is absolutely required for data collection with Survey Solutions. 6. We don’t have a proper server. Are there any alternatives? You can install Survey Solutions using major cloud server providers: Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others. The software and functionality is the same regardless whether it is installed in the cloud or on a local machine. 7. How many servers will we need? One server can handle hundreds of interviewers and supervisors, and is sufficient for a typical household survey with tens of thousands households. In some situations multiple servers may present additional convenience, or even be required. 2. Connectivity 8. Does the World Bank Group provide connectivity devices and cover connection charges for Survey Solutions? No. It is up to the client to arrange proper network infrastructure, purchase any necessary devices, obtain SIM-cards (if necessary), and cover the traffic usage fees. 9. Is it possible to ”synchronize” the server periodically or do I need a constant connection? The interviewers and supervisors will attempt to connect to the server at their convenience, so the server must be reachable at all times when the interviewers may decide to synchronize. The server connection to Internet must hence be fast and reliable. 10. Should my server be connected to Internet? The tablets will need to send data to the server, so it must be visible and reachable. In most cases this means the tablets and the server are communicating over the Internet. For physical installations it is possible to send the data through a LAN without sending the data over the Internet, but the tablets must also be connected to the same LAN. Usually this means the tablets must be within the WiFi range from the server (up to about 20-30 meters away). Since the tablets are expected to synchronize frequently, this is an inconvenient and rare scenario. 11. Do the tablets need a network connection during an interview? No. The interviews are conducted while the tablets are not connected. Internet connection is not required and 3G/4G or WiFi traffic is not consumed during interviews. Survey Solutions accumulates collected data on the tablet and sends it to the server during synchronization. 12. 3G/4G coverage is rather spotty in our country. Is it still possible to use Survey Solutions? Connection can be utilized when available, but spotty coverage would imply more travelling to the areas where signal is available for synchronizations. 13. How often should the tablets synchronize? This depends on the protocol of a particular survey. For example: every day; or twice a day. More frequent synchronizations allow faster turnaround. 14. We don’t want to send our data over the air. Is it possible to avoid using WiFi? Modern Android-based tablets usually do not have an Ethernet socket for wired connection and provide exclusively WiFi, and (for some models) 3G/4G connectivity. This is the limitation of the devices, not the Survey Solutions software. 15. Is the communication over the Internet secure? Survey Solutions uses password protection and authorization procedures to authenticate all users and communications. Installing an SSL certificate for the server allows additional encryption of all data. Our experts are available to discuss particular risks and other specific security concerns. 3. Tablets 16. Which brand and model of tablets should I buy? The World Bank is not in the position to point to a particular brand and model as ”the tablet” for Survey Solutions. The choice depends on multiple different characteristics and the decision on the model depends on the client, subject to the technical requirements and market availability. The characteristics to evaluate are usually: performance, memory, storage, connectivity, screen, battery, price, convenience and ergonomics.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"February 8, 2019","objectID":"b181af836e87d07dc9ad04474ab7bd35","section":"Getting Started","title":"FAQ for IT personnel","type":"getting-started","url":"/getting-started/faq-for-it-personnel/","wordcount":2987},{"content":" Other characteristics may affect the decision if used in the data collection: GPS sensor, optical camera, etc. 17. What requirements does Survey Solutions have for the tablets? See Technical Requirements for Tablets 18. What screen size is best for Survey Solutions? 7-8-inch screens are often picked as suitable in typical operations. Bigger screens consume more power and reduce autonomous work. The choice of the screen should depend on the convenience of use with the software and is usually determined experimentally. 19. Will we need additional batteries? Modern tablets have battery life typically ranging from 6 to 12 hours, which is usually sufficient for a day of work of an interviewer. If the interviewers remain in a remote area without access to power grid for a prolonged period, they may need additional sources of power. External batteries of various capacities can provide a quick solution. Other things being equal it is useful to have a charge indicator on a battery. Charging from car batteries or portable generators may also bepossible depending on the survey situation. 20. Can autonomous life of a tablet be extended without any additional equipment? It is possible to use the device settings to minimize power consumption: adjust screen brightness; switch off bluetooth; switch off GPS if not used; switch off WiFi when not in use, etc; 21. Should we buy new tablets specifically for Survey Solutions or is it possible to use our existing stock of tablets? If the tablets you have satisfy the hardware and software requirements, they usually can be used with the Survey Solutions. Note that the capacity of the batteries found in most tablets reduces sharply after about 1.5-2 years. Older tablets might thus still be used but may require more maintenance and power backup options. If the tablets are still in use for other purposes, other software installed on them will be competing for the resources (memory and CPU). Make sure there is sufficient storage space available to install and operate Survey Solutions. 22. Should all the tablets used in the survey be identical brand and model? No. Different tablet models may be used as long as they satisfy the minimal requirements. Typical situations are: Note that 3G/4G connectivity adds to the cost of the device. If the interviewers in a particular region are expected to be always covered by WiFi connectivity, for example if they are coming to the office daily, they might use a tablet without 3G/4G connectivity. Another situation is when the operations are scaled up from a smaller survey or pilot to a full size survey, or a larger survey, and the original model is no longer available on the market. In that case a new model can be used alongside the older ones, as long as they are still functioning. Using the same model usually simplifies the support. If there is a problem or an advisory, the survey administrator knows that it affects all the eqipment in a similar fashion. 23. How many tablets will we need to purchase? One per interviewer. Have some spares in case a tablet gets lost, stolen, or damaged. Number of spares depends on the particular situation. Reserving 1 spare tablet for every 20 active interviewers is indicative. 24. We plan to start fieldwork on May 1 and the supplier promised to deliver the tablets by April 30. That’s ok, right? Entirely up to you, but someone will need to check and register all the devices, charge them, install the software, create user accounts, verify everything is in order and fix what’s not. The training for use of the tablets as instruments of data collection is essential, and it is only successful if it includes practice with the actual devices. Thus the devices should arrive before the interviewers’ training. 25. How many tablets will we need to purchase for the supervisors? None. Supervisors work with computers, not tablets. If the supervisors travel with the interviewers, they should be equipped with a laptop to work in the field. If the supervisors stay in the office, they may use a laptop or a desktop computer. 26. What are the requirements for a supervisor’s computer? Windows-based computer, OS Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10; 4GB RAM, 120GB hard drive space (SSD drive is preferable); If the supervisor is working in the field, then connectivity from the field via 3G or 4G, (built-in, USB, or external wireless modem, or a similar device). 4. Database 27. What database does Survey Solutions use to store data? How can we access it from our system? Survey Solutions uses a proprietary database system to store and retrieve the data. Data in the Survey Solutions database is not directly accessible from any other software the client might use for other operations. The data is exported by the Survey Solutions server on demand in the form of a downloadable file. 28. What is the format of the exported file? Is it suitable for our software X? The software exports the data as an archive containing multiple files in tab-delimited unicode text format. Binary files (images) are downloaded separately. Survey Solutions documentation explains the particulars on how questions of different types (numeric, text, choice, etc) are saved in the data file. Tab-delimited text format is a popular data interchange format suitable for import for many modern databases, spreadsheets, and statistical packages. Consult your software operating manual on the support of tab-delimited (also known as tab-separated) data. 5. Maintenance, etc 29. Our system is set up and running. Should we change anything? Installing updates is one of the most common tasks to be performed. Install the updates and especially security updates for the server as recommended by the OS provider. For tablets there is usually no additional benefit to install further OS updates if the Survey Solutions is already working smoothly. There is a need to periodically update Survey Solutions as well. The most convenient time for this is in between the surveys. 30. If we host Survey Solutions on our own server,","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"February 8, 2019","objectID":"b181af836e87d07dc9ad04474ab7bd35","section":"Getting Started","title":"FAQ for IT personnel","type":"getting-started","url":"/getting-started/faq-for-it-personnel/","wordcount":2987},{"content":" how do we make sure that we get the updates? Notifications about new version releases are routinely posted as: Release notes The update of the server component of Survey Solutions is not automatic and should be undertaken by the server administrator after careful consideration of the new features and current data collection situation. The updates procedure depends both on the most recent and the installed version of Survey Solutions. Lagging behind for several versions is not recommended as this means you are not getting the bugfixes and access to the new features. If you are reporting a bug, our first recommendation is usually to catch up with the currently released version. 31. Can we restrict the tablets so that no other software can be used on the tablets? Survey Solutions generally doesn’t mind presence of other software as long as it is not demanding too much of the tablet’s resources. But in some cases the survey administrators restrict the use of other software, for example, to reduce wireless bills due to unwanted communications. Depending on your choice of the tablet and desired functionality, this possibility may be provided by the operating system (restricted account), third party software, or a combination of both. 32. If a tablet is lost or damaged before synchronizing, is there any way to retrieve the data that has not yet been synchronized? If a tablet is lost, the unsynchronized data is lost with it. If a tablet is damaged, sometimes data can be recovered from it (depends on the damage). For example, if only the tablet’s battery fails, the data could be recovered by connecting the tablet to an external power source, replacing the battery, or using other similar techniques. The World Bank does not provide technicians for this kind of recovery operations. In some cases, if a tablet is damaged, the data cannot be recovered (memory damage, etc). Data recovery from a damaged device is usually a costly operation. In practice it may be more cost-efficient to collect a number of replacement observations instead of trying to recover a handful of observations from a damaged device. To minimize the risks of data loss, synchronize tablets often and protect the tablet (cover case, rugged jacket, carrying bag, etc). 33. If an interviewer is assigned a new tablet during the field work can she use the same log in information on the new tablet to retrieve the surveys she needs to complete? Starting from version 4.1 of Survey Solutions each interviewer can work only on one device tracked by the system. In case of tablet’s loss or damage the interviewer can switch to using a replacement tablet. Depending on the circumstances of loss or damage the change of credentials may be recommended as well. After logging in from the new device the interviewer has to confirm the switch of the device. Old device is automatically excluded and no data from it will ever be accepted. The interviewer can continue her work on the new replacement device from the point consistent with the last synchronization. 34. We want to host Survey Solutions on our own server. Can we back up it’s proprietary database? Yes. Our developers will instruct which files need to be backed up in your particular installation. You can schedule the backups of those files with your desired frequency. 35. If I have to make changes to the questionnaire during the field work, for example I want to add response options to a question, how do I get these changes to the interviewers? Any changes to questionnaires are not automatically delivered to interviewers. Each Survey Solutions server contains a copy of the questionnaire used for data collection, which is imported by the headquarter user. Importing a new version of the questionnaire to the Survey Solutions server does not affect existing assignments for that survey, but defines the questionnaire that will be used for future assignments. To update the questionnaire for existing assignments, they must be deleted and recreated usign the newly imported version of the questionnaire. This is only possible for blank assignments and not for started / completed / rejected / etc. Updating questionnaire after the fieldwork has started is not recommended. 36. Is the data on the Designer site shared between the users? The Designer site http://designer.mysurvey.solutions/ is intended for designing the survey questionnaires. It does not store or share the data collected during surveys using those questionnaires, but stores blank forms only. Multiple users can collaborate and work on developing questionnaire forms together. 37. Can we use tablets or Apple computers to design a survey using the online designer tool? The implementation of browser functionality differs between different browsers and different platforms. Survey Solutions Designer does not explicitly rule out the use of any particular browser or platform. However, the use of anything else beyond the current Windows versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge is not tested, not supported, and not guaranteed. The use of Microsoft Internet Explorer has been deprecated. To download a compatible browser visit links below: Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Edge 38. What is a Survey Solutions Demo server? Demo Headquarter server is set up for demonstration purposes so that anyone can try how the Survey Solutions program works and evaluate its functionality and suitability for their survey. For that reason, the access to the headquarter server is not restricted and anyone can login there. The Demo server is not intended for any real data collection. Read more about the use of the demo server (including login and password to access it) in this article. 39. We like your system and we want to change it (improve it, modify it, customize it). How should we start? We do not distribute the source code of Survey Solutions. We listen to the suggestions of our users. If there is a useful feature that is missing from our functionality, please let us know in the [forum](https://forum.mysurvey.solutions).","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"February 8, 2019","objectID":"b181af836e87d07dc9ad04474ab7bd35","section":"Getting Started","title":"FAQ for IT personnel","type":"getting-started","url":"/getting-started/faq-for-it-personnel/","wordcount":2987},{"content":" Survey Solutions system is based on the hierarchy of users which perform their responsibilities based on the commands of superior users. Every survey starts by a headquarters user deciding on the questionnaire (importing the questionnaire from the Designer to the data server) and making assignments to supervisors, which can in turn assign to individual interviewers. Assignment are orders to subordinate users to take part in the survey. Not only they are directed at a particular user, but most importantly the assignments determine the area of responsibility of that user. So that in the system it is clear that not only interviewers A and B are collecting, say census data, but also that interviewer A is responsible for enumeration areas 1,2,3 and interviewer B for 4,5,6. Of course the responsibilities can be divided not by enumeration areas, but by some other attributes or address components: streets or villages for household surveys, facilities for patient surveys, markets for price surveys, etc. An assignment is thus comprised of several obligatory components: survey questionnaire - which survey must be conducted, which questionnaire to be used? responsible person - who must perform this task? identifying information - where the interviewers should collect the response? number of interviews - how many interviews must be collected? The first attribute, survey name never changes: from the time the assignment is created for a particular survey, it stays unchanged throughout the circulation of it in the system. The person responsible for an assignment may change. The original responsible may be changed to a different person, for example the supervisor may pass an assignment to one of her interviewers, or re-assign an assignment to a different interviewer. With regards to the third attribute, the identifying information, we can think of assignments as precise or imprecise. Precise assignments have all their identifying questions answered, while imprecise assignments have only some, but not all identifying questions answered. It is typical for an imprecise assignment to result in multiple interviews. In fact this is very natural for survey planners to think in these categories: how many individual households to interview in a particular enumeration area, or how many patients in a particular health facility, etc. This number (capacity, quota) may be known, such as 12 households from enumeration area, or unknown, such as all households located between N.Lincoln Ave, N.Halstedt St, and W.Webster Ave in Chicago, IL. Of course, the addressing system is different in different countries and for different contexts. But once the questionnaire is designed, it does have one or more identifying questions. When an assignment is made, the headquarters user decides, which questions he can answer, and which ones he leaves unanswered. It becomes the responsibility of the interviewer to fill out all the identifying questions that were not assigned values by the headquarters user that has created the assignment. For example, if the assignment is to interview 16 households in the city block located between N.Lincoln Ave, N.Halstedt St, and W.Webster Ave in Chicago, IL, then the interviewer may be expected to fill out the fields of the street number, floor, and apartment number as well as the name of the household head. Once this information is entered by an interviewer, it can no longer be changed. For scenarios where the number of interviews is unknown, an infinite limit may be imposed by setting the number of interviews to -1 (negative one). In this case the interviewer will be able to create as many new interviews as necessary. Both the number of conducted interviews and the number of remaining interviews in an assignment are displayed at interviewer\u0026rsquo;s dashboard. The limit can be revised (increased or decreased) by the headquarters users. During batch upload of interviews, this limit is placed into the variable _quantity. If this variable is not specified, 1 is assumed. The person responsible for the assignment may be specified in the variable _responsible (accepts login names of supervisors or interviewers). Other attributes of an assignment I addition to the above attributes, Survey Solutions assigns a unique identifier to each assignment, tracks the date of the creation and last modification of an assignment. The progress of completion is reflected with: number of submitted interviews and total interviews for the supervisors/headquarters users, and number of created interviews and number of remaining interviews for the interviewers. Difference between an assignment and interview. It is important to recognize the difference between an assignment and an interview. An assignment is a different entity, and is being tracked in Survey Solutions separately from interviews data. An assignment is thus a permission to instantiate interviews, all of them will be marked by the identifying information contained in the original assignment. Recall from the basic description of the work of a supervisor is that his two main tasks are managing of the work load of his interviewers and performing quality control of collected interviews. The supervisor is doing them by distributing the assignments (obtained from Headquarters) and by doing quality control (verifying answers, exchanging comments) of the interviews. Note that assignments are not reflected in the reports on interviews, and they may not be opened for inspection. An assignment may be deleted by the headquarters users, in which case the corresponding card will be removed from the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s dashboard after synchronization. For any incompleted assignments,any interviews that have been already sent to the server by an interviewer are not deleted when an incompleted assignment is deleted, but after synchronization the interviewer will no longer have a possibility to collect data based on such assignment. Transition notes Earlier versions of Survey Solutions had two distinct modes of data collection: Sample mode and Census mode. For users that conducted their surveys in the sample mode, there is little to no distinction with the earlier operation. The same sample preloading files may be used with newer versions, but there is no need (or in fact a possibility) to specify any mode during the questionnaire import. For users that conducted their surveys in the census mode, there is a","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"July 24, 2017","objectID":"85347f605155e0de1305cd93f9823631","section":"Getting Started","title":"Assignments","type":"getting-started","url":"/getting-started/assignments/","wordcount":1099},{"content":" change. The change is that the interviewers cannot start working without prior having an assignment, and hence a headquarters user must upload an assignments file with two columns _responsible and _quantity , where _responsible contains names of all interviewers and _quantity is set to -1 (negative one) for each of them.

Don\u0026rsquo;t neglect Google or other search engines. This is usually the fastest way to get your issue resolved. It will also help you to use the right terminology when asking a question. All of the questions of the kind \u0026ldquo;Is it possible to do X in Survey Solutions?\u0026quot; or \u0026ldquo;How do I do X in Survey Solutions?\u0026quot; should not be sent to the support team directly, but rather be posted to the user forum as public questions. Write your request clearly. If we don\u0026rsquo;t understand it, we will not be able to help and it will take multiple rounds of emails to obtain clarification, ultimately resulting in a slower resolution. Messages simply reporting \u0026ldquo;X doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;X is not working\u0026rdquo; without steps to reproduce the problem will be immediately returned to sender for clarification without further investigation. Most of the reports of the type \u0026ldquo;X doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rdquo; are because X never existed or never intended to work the way you imagined it. While describing the issue refer to the documentation and indicate which instruction you\u0026rsquo;ve followed, and what was the specific problem (which error message you received exactly, whether the program has frozen, computer rebooted, etc).

Once you receive the answer to your request, you can forward it to your partners/co-authors. Confirm promptly if the issue is resolved once you receive the answer. We will not be able to address your case until all previous support cases are closed. Once the issue is resolved and you have a new issue, start a new request, do not answer to the old thread of the resolved issue. Do not write \u0026ldquo;Thank you for resolving issue A, and I have two more questions B and C\u0026rdquo;. Instead close the thread of issue A confirming it is resolved, start a new request for issue B and start another for issue C. Urgent requests: all requests are urgent. Consequently all requests will be served in the order they arrive. Use attachments to supplement your case description: place screenshots for interface issues; place long error messages verbatim in a separate text file; include preloading files in text format; explain which tool was used to produce these files; include PDF version of the questionnaire if necessary. If the issue is related to a particular questionnaire, copy the link to it from the list of your questionnaires in the Designer. In general requests for server maintenance, such as erasing a survey, resetting credentials, upgrading the version of the server component, etc are expected from the person designated as responsible for the server. We reserve the possibility to deny the requests from other persons if we can’t reliably establish their relationship to the data server in question. Check the support address. This is the support line for the Survey Solutions software. If you are experiencing a device issue, perhaps you should contact the device manufacturer?

Some examples of use could be: schedule periodic export of collected data an external dashboard or monitoring and reporting system, which updates some indicators every night and publishes them to a website, or an external checking and validation system which verifies collected data against some external sources of information and rejects automatically the incorrect interviews, or an integrated system, which utilizes Survey Solutions for data collections tasks and a statistical package for continuous analysis, facility management, inventory and price monitoring systems, etc, etc. It is up to our users to decide on the particular scenario of use taking into account their needs and existing legacy systems already in place. The integration mode is usually dictated by the external system, which may determine, for example, in which language the system is implemented or to which storage the data is transferred from Survey Solutions. To utilize an API in your application an API user account must be created by the server administrator: What Survey Solutions is making available to external applications/systems is a set of levers, which allow performing the same tasks performed by the actual users of the software. This functionality is implemented through a set of standardized web requests which are documented in the following interactive guide for API users.

Our objective is to present the questions in different order for different respondents. Our other objective is to avoid pre-programming sequences of questions, as this is tedious and creates questionnaires with just a few sequences of questions. We will rely on the following Survey Solutions elements: text substitution (text-piping) with the whole question text being substituted; random value to make the sequences of questions differ for different respondents; shuffling algorithm, we will use D. Knuth\u0026rsquo;s version of the Fisher-Yates algorithm, but many others will do just as well; and a few other tricks. In Survey Solutions Designer tool, we will compose a questionnaire like the following: This questionnaire is available as Public example: Randomizing order of questions Note that questions q1..q7 contain identical set of options (the feedback scale in this example) and have their texts computed by respective calculated variables t1..t7. Each of the variables in turn is computed based on selecting the corresponding item from a shuffled array of questions, which is delivered by a macro: Note also that we are using only one random number even though we have N steps of shuffling, we do this by looking at different digits of that number, which for our purposes may be assumed random as well. This of course imposes some limitations on this example realization, which will be limited by 10 items. We specifically avoid following the pseudorandom sequence of numbers in Survey Solutions, since we will need to reshuffle the answers back to match the original sequence of questions (non-randomized) after the data is exported from Survey Solutions. This could be trivial if the processing is done in the same language (C#), but is not possible if other packages are used (Stata, SPSS), since they are utilizing their own random number generators. Two other tricks that we do here is rounding the random number to a smaller number of digits to avoid precision problems during export and re-import to another system, and taking a logarithm from a random number to obtain a sufficiently long sequence of random digits. The questions will be presented in a random order for the interviewer: And the final step to do is to reorder the answers back to the proper order after the data is exported. This can be done by replicating the same shuffle with a script and restoring back the order of the items based on the shuffled sequence. For example, this is how we can do this in Stata In order to generate some example data use this script. Based on replicated sequence of pseudorandom numbers, the answers are easily placed in the proper order:","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"July 17, 2017","objectID":"a976fcee335ab82ec37cca3e8c32c401","section":"Questionnaire Designer","title":"Randomizing order of questions","type":"questionnaire-designer","url":"/questionnaire-designer/techniques/randomizing-order-of-questions/","wordcount":459},{"content":" Moving from interviews to assignments Conceptually, version 5.21 introduces an important change in how interview assignments are distributed. Previously, survey managers had a binary choice for distributing assignments: sample or census mode. Sample mode offered complete control over survey targets, but imposed the cost of specifying all identifying information for each survey target (e.g., name, address, etc.). Census mode offered complete flexibility for identifying survey targets, but provided no control over the identifying information of potential survey targets (e.g., region where households have been selected). Now, with assignments, survey managers have a continuum of choices: sample mode, census mode, and everything in between. To be clear, users can still distribute interviews just as before. But, importantly, there are also new choices that are more closely aligned with common, but previously unmet, user needs. To see this, consider a few use cases. When faced with HQ-based selection of primary sampling units (PSUs) but field-based sampling of households, survey managers can now pre-populate identifying details of PSUs (e.g., region, district, village name) while requiring interviewers to provide identifying details of households selected for interview (e.g., household head\u0026rsquo;s name, etc.). When confronted with tracking members of a panel study, survey managers can now dynamically determined the number of copies of interviews associated with an assignment, so that any split-offs from an original household can be quickly captured with the benefit of any preloaded information. Practically, this conceptual change in version 5.21 is relatively minor for all users. For Headquarters, there is no longer any need to choose the mode of distribution (i.e., select sample or census mode). When assignments are created, the mode of distribution is determined by the quantity of interviews associated with an assignment (i.e., 1 to replicate sample mode, unlimited to replicate census mode, and for new modes some number in between). For Supervisor, survey management now happens in two spaces. When making or revising assignments, supervisors work from the Assignments screen. When reviewing completed interviews, supervisors work from the Interviews screen. In other words, there is a space for each entity. Assignments in Assignments; Interviews in Interviews. For Interviewer, there is a new tab on the dashboard: Create New. From this tab, interviewers can create interviews from their assignments. For example, if an assignment consists of three interviews, the interviewer can create up to three interviews. Once an interview is created, it moves from one status tab to another as before (e.g., Started, Completed, etc.). Meanwhile, the list of all assignments will remain in the Create New tab. For a compact but comprehensive summary of what\u0026rsquo;s new and how legacy questionnaires are handled, read here. Interviewer improvements The Interviewer application has seen three improvements aimed at increasing usability. Interviewer app updates are incremental. Previously, updating the Interviewer application required downloading the full installation file with each new release. Now, updating the application downloads a smaller file, making it easier and less costly for interviewers to keep their tablets up to date in the field. Upgrading from the previous version to the current version might require downloading just few hundred kilobytes. Dashboard cards are expandable. Previously, assignment cards displayed only the first three identifying questions. Now, cards can be expanded to see all identifying questions. To expand a card, simply tap. To collapse, tap the card again. Dashboard interface uses swipe navigation. Previously, interviewers needed to tap on the status tab to move between lists of interviews (e.g., Started, Completed). Now, they can swipe right or left. Designer improvements The Designer application has also seen several improvements to usability: Login with email address. Previously, users needed to enter their login in order to access Designer or recover their password. Now, they may also use the email address used to sign up for their Designer account, making login and password recovery easier. Save partially complete questions and validations. Previously, questionnaire designers needed to complete the question text field before saving a question, and provide an error message to save a validation. Now, designers may leave both blank. Questions without question text will appear as compilation errors. Validations without error messages will simply not show an error message for invalid answers. These changes makes creating rough drafts easier. Simplifies data types. Previously, Survey Solutions several C# data types to store answers to questions and values of system variables. Now, those data types have simplified. The number of types have been reduced. The types now more closely match user intuition. Most users will not notice the change. Advanced users should consult this summary table of data types. Tester improvements Previously, testing with Tester could be tedious. When a problem was found in a questionnaire, one made a correction in Designer, reloaded the questionnaire in Tester, and then re-entered testing data. Now, when the user reloads a questionnaire, Tester tries to keep all previously entered data intact. That way, one can more quickly confirm that identified problems have been resolved. Application Programming Interface (API) In version 5.21, Survey Solutions' API have been considerably improved and expanded. First, virtually every user action now has a corresponding API (e.g., creating assignments, assigning interviews, downloading data, and approving and rejecting interviews). Second, each server features up-to-date and interactive documentation on what API actions are allowed, how to formulate them, and what server responses to expect. Please note that this feature is aimed at advanced users who are comfortable with server queries and REST APIs. Area question type Working in partnership with ESRI, the Survey Solutions team has integrated some of ESRI\u0026rsquo;s mobile GIS tools into Survey Solutions. The result: a new question type that measures area by tracing a shape\u0026rsquo;s outlines on satellite imagery (e.g., bounds of a farmer\u0026rsquo;s field). The appeal: the ability to measure area without traversing a shape (e.g., walking around a farmer\u0026rsquo;s potentially distant field). In version 5.21, this new question type should be considered experimental. In future versions, this question type will be improved and extended. Stay tuned.","keywords":["5.21"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"July 6, 2017","objectID":"fd6c905a8991ac211fb631a0240f1c27","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 5.21","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-5-21/","wordcount":986},{"content":" With version 5.21, we are making a big change by replacing census and sample mode with assignments. Previously when importing a questionnaire, users had to decide between sample mode (with a quantity of 1 interview per case) and census mode (with an unlimited quantity of interviews). With version 5.21, users will simply import the questionnaire and then proceed to making assignments with the imported template. Assignments will give headquarters users more flexibility because they can now specify the quantity of interviews they want when they generate each assignment. What\u0026rsquo;s New with Assignments Users will no longer be asked to specify census mode or sample mode when importing a questionnaire Headquarters/admin can now specify the quantity of interviews they would like an interviewer to perform for each assignment. Headquarters/admin users will still be able to o specify an unlimited number of interviews per assignment (previously known as census mode). To specify an unlimited quantity when creating assignments one at a time, leave the *Quantity *field blank when creating the assignment. To add quantity in batch uploads for assignments, add a column titled _quantity to your tab delimited file to specify the quantity for each assignment. To specify an unlimited quantity, put \u0026lsquo;-1\u0026rsquo; in the _quantity column for that assignment. Assignments can now be made to either supervisors or interviewers. Previously, assignments could only be made to supervisors. Headquarter/admin users are no longer required to to fill out all the identifying variables when making an assignment. Interviewers can fill in any identifying information that was left blank by the headquarters/admin users when the assignment was created. Interviewers can discard incomplete interviews that are made accidentally or are no longer valid. Compatibility with older versions If you currently have a survey in the field and the tablets have the Interviewer application of versions earlier than 5.21, it is not necessary to update the interviewer application on the tablets to proceed with fieldwork. To prevent disruption to your fieldwork, version 5.21 on the server will be backwards compatible with previous versions of the Interviewer application. Below are important information on compatibility: Synchronization to the server: Synchronization of completed and rejected interviews on tablets with Interviewer application versions earlier than 5.21 will work the same as before. Making assignments with a template imported in an older version: Assignments can still be made to supervisors/interviewers with templates imported on versions older than 5.21. The interviewer application does not need to be updated to 5.21 to receive these assignments made with questionnaires imported in an older version. Similar to previous versions, interviewers will see one card per interview. Additionally, assignments can be made using templates imported in older versions to tablets running version 5.21 of Interviewer applications. The cards for the assignments will look the same as an assignment created with a template imported in version 5.21. Making assignments with a newly imported template to an older version of the Interviewer application: If you make any assignments with a questionnaire template imported after your server has been updated to version 5.21, then the interviewers will have to update their Interviewer applications to version 5.21 in order to receive any assignments made with those templates. Interviewers will see an error when they try to login prompting them to update their Interviewer application. Interviewers can update in the Interviewer application by going to the link in the Diagnostics screen. Interviews created in previous versions: You will still be able to see and complete interviews created with earlier versions after updating the Interviewer application to version 5.21. However, these interviews cannot be discarded. Census mode questionnaires: Questionnaires imported as census mode will have the same functionality as before. It will have the added feature of being able to discard an interview that has been started. Batch upload of assignments: Users can continue to use the same batch upload tab files that they used in previous versions. If the tab file has no quantity column (column title: _quantity) or the quantity is left blank, then one interview will automatically be created for each assignment.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"July 5, 2017","objectID":"969a69bf5f761e329caf5b07a32f3683","section":"FAQ","title":"Notes on Compatibility with version 5.21","type":"faq","url":"/faq/notes-on-compatibility-with-version-5-21/","wordcount":673},{"content":" Overview of the Interviewer Dashboard The Interviewer dashboard offers an overview of the interviewer’s assignments and the state of completion they are in. The tabs displayed at the top of the dashboard sorts interviews by their status.

To help interviewers differentiate between the different tabs, the color of the dashboard will change based on which tab the interviewer is currently in. The interface will be grey for the Create New tab, blue for the **Started **tab, green for the Completed tab, and red for the Rejected tab. Information for Assignments The card for each assignment will have a number at the top. This number will correspond to the assignment number that Headquarters and Supervisors user will also use to identify the assignment. Next to the assignment number will be the number of interviews that remains to be completed by the interviewer. This number will decrease as the interviewer completes more interviews. Additionally, each card will be have the identifying information for each assignment or interview. The first three identifying variables will be shown on the card for each assignment or interview. If there are more than three identifying variables for the assignment, the rest will be hidden. To reveal the other identifying information, tap once on the assignment\u0026rsquo;s card. Interview statuses There are four possible statuses on the Dashboard: Create New: This tab will list all the assignments that an interviewer has. Interviewers can create new interviews for their assignments. To start a new interview, interviewers will tap on the blue Start button on the assignment. If all the required interviews for an assignment have already been created, then the Start will be grayed out. The dashboard will be grey while in this tab.

Tap on the card to see all the identifying information. This will also reveal the Start. Tap on the blue Start button for the assignment to create a new interview. If the questionnaire is large, a load screen may appear before the questionnaire cover page appears. Step 2 The interviewer will see all the identifying information for that new interview. If Headquarters has filled out the identifying variable, then the interviewer will see the information prefilled and there will be a lock next to that information. Interviewers will not be able to change any identifying information that Headquarters has already filled out. If any identifying variable was not provided by Headquarters, the interviewer should fill out that information before starting the interview. After filling out any necessary identifying information, click on the blue Start at the bottom of the screen. Step 3 You will then see a summary of all the identyfing information and links to question level comments left by the supervisor and headquarters user. Review the information and make sure everything is correct, and then click on the blue Start button at the bottom of the screen to start the interview. To view the comments, click on a red question link. How to exit an interview Tap on the menu button on the top right and select *Dashboard. * You will be directed back to the dashboard.

For each questionnaire, you will see the following information: name of questionnaire, version, the date and time the questionnaire was imported to the server, the date and time the questionnaire was created on Designer, and the date and time the questionnaire was last changed on Designer. The questionnaires can be sorted by any of these information. Import template button: This will allow you to import a new questionnaire onto the server Search button: If you have a lot of questionnaires on your server, you can quickly search for the questionnaire you want by clicking on the search button and typing the name of the questionnaire. Import a questionnaire template When clicked, the green Import template button prompts the user to connect to the Designer site and to select a questionnaire template for import. To connect to Designer, headquarters must enter a valid login and password (as pictured below). Note that these login credentials are for the Designer site, not the headquarters software. After connecting to the Designer site, the user must select a questionnaire template to import. To do so, the user must first find a questionnaire, either by scrolling through the list of questionnaires available or using the search box. Click on the questionnaire to import it. Then, you will be prompted to confirm the import. Once import of the selected questionnaire is complete, the name of that questionnaire appears in the list of questionnaires on the Questionnaires tab. If this is the first time the questionnaire has been imported, the headquarters software will add “(1)” in the column titled \u0026ldquo;Version\u0026rdquo;. Each time a new version of the same questionnaire is imported, the software will add the corresponding version number in that column. When a new version of an existing questionnaire is imported to the server, any unfulfilled assignments in the old version may be migrated to the new version. If the HQ user decides to migrate the assignments, the system will examine them one by one and decide whether the migration is possible and if so, archive the original assignment and recreate a new assignment in the new version of the questionnaire (for the remaining number of interviews still not delivered). We recommend testing the questionnaires extensively to minimize any revisions to the questionnaires during fieldwork. Create assignments To create assignment, click on the questionnaire you want to create assignments for. Then you will see a menu that will have two options for creating assignments: New Assignment, which creates assignments one at a time; and Upload assignment , which creates several assignments at once. One assignment at a time After clicking on *New assignment *menu, you will be prompted to provide identifying information for the survey case—typically name and geographic location of the respondent—and to select a supervisor/interviewer to be responsible for the assignment. The system does not require you to fill in all the information. The set of identifying information, which corresponds to the questions marked as Identifying on the Designer site, should be provided by headquarters when creating a case and will appear on the interviewer’s dashboard when assigned. ** **Next, define the number of interviews that should be generated for the assignment. To allow an unlimited number of interviews, leave the Quantity field blank. You will also prompted to designate a supervisor/interviewer as responsible for the case (Responsible). Once assigned to a supervisor, the survey case will appear on the supervisor’s dashboard and will be available to assign to one of the supervisor’s data collection team. If assigned to a interviewer, the survey case will appear on the interviewers device after synchronization.

The headquarters software offers two ways of using external .tab files to pre-fill survey cases in a batch upload: Identifying data only, typically used for cross-sectional surveys, which loads only respondent address information (e.g., region, enumeration area, village, name of household head) An advanced mode which involves preloading info (identifying data and collected data), typically used for panel surveys, which loads not only information on the respondent’s address, but also information for any other field of the questionnaire (e.g., name and age all of household members from last wave of data collection). For uploading assignments , either create a .tab file with variable names of identifying questions or download the template. Then, in the first row variable names and variable values in subsequent rows. The variable names in the top row of the .tab file must match those in the Designer template. The format of those variables must match those specified in Designer. To set a specific number of cases for each assignment add the column _quantity. Then, upload the data in the .tab file. To do so, first click on the \u0026ldquo;Upload .TAB File\u0026rdquo; and","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"June 29, 2017","objectID":"d36ab16c8426bac914084f4399097f2d","section":"Headquarters","title":"Survey Setup Tab: Import, Copy, and Delete Questionnaire Templates, and Create Assignments","type":"headquarters","url":"/headquarters/preloading/survey-setup-tab-import-copy-and-delete-questionnaire-templates-and-create-assignments/","wordcount":2077},{"content":" select your file. Next, the headquarters software will confirm that the uploaded .tab file contains valid contents and follows the format that the headquarters software expects. If there are any error messages, check the .tab file and make the necessary changes. Otherwise, proceed to the next step. Then, select the person responsible for this batch of survey assignments. To do so, choose the username from the drop-down menu. Lastly, click on Create Assignments. Note that in this method headquarters must upload one .tab file per person responsible. However, you can upload one .tab for the survey sample by adding a column in the .tab file with the heading _responsible and populating all the fields with the appropriate interviewer or supervisor usernames. Preloading Preloading (identifying and collected data) is used primarily for panel surveys, is generally similar to the mode described previously but involves a few additional steps. To preload both identifying and collected data, you need to first create a .tab file or set of .tab files. To do this, click on the *download .zip template *link. A .zip file containing one .tab file for each hierarchical level in the questionnaire will download (e.g., one file containing all household-level variables, another file containing all household member-level variables, and still another file containing all consumption item-level variables). In other words, this provides headquarters with a template to fill with any pre-existing information about the survey cases that will be created. While the number of such template files depends on the questionnaire, the structures of these template files follow the same format. Each file is composed of: Id, ParentId, and all other variables. The Id is meant to be a unique identifier for the template file (e.g. a simple serial number). The ParentId is an identifier that links a lower-level item to a higher-level item (e.g., serial number of household that operate a plot). If a roster is nested in another roster, the template file can also have ParentId1 and ParentId2. See the image below for a graphical explanation. The other variables in the file correspond to the variables present at that hierarchical level of observation. Note that the numbering in the subordinate data files should correspond to the type of roster, please refer to this article for more information. Once the .tab file has been created, fill it with three sets of information. First, headquarters must provide the same set of respondent address information as outlined in the previous section—that is, information for the fields marked in the Designer tool as Identifying. Second, headquarters may fill in any pre-existing information about respondents, using any field in the questionnaire. This would be done by filling in the columns for any variables, in any one of the .tab files that make up the questionnaire template. These questions will not appear on the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s dashboard, and the values can be edited on the tablet. (For information on how to protect the values of some question types from being changed on the tablet, please refer to this article). Third, headquarters must include identifiers in the Id and ParentId fields so that each record is unique and that the headquarters software can link each *child *.tab file to its parent file. The Id, typically a simple number, serves as a unique identifier for each record—that is, a computer identifier that is distinct from the case identifiers used for locating respondents. The ParentId links records at one level of hierarchy with records from another level of hierarchy—for example, an Id that links household members with the household to which they belong. After all .tab files have been filled in this way, zip all the .tab files into one .zip file. Then, upload the .zip file using Upload Zip File button. As in the previous method of creating cases, the headquarter software will then evaluate the uploaded files for validity and consistency with the questionnaire template. If any errors are identified, correct the files. Otherwise proceed to the next step and assign the batch of cases to a supervisor. Note that headquarters must either upload one set of .tab files per supervisor (i.e., one .zip file containing one or more .tab files) or one .tab file for all supervisors where each survey case has been assigned a supervisor within the file. Copy questionnaire templates (Administrators) Cloning questionnaires on headquarters allows you to start a new survey using the same questionnaire that has been imported to the HQ previously. To copy a questionnaire in headquarters, click on the questionnaire you would like to copy and then select Clone questionnaire from the menu. If necessary, a new name can be given to the survey initiated from a cloned questionnaire, such as LFS Quarter 1, LFS Quarter 2, and so on.

Survey Solutions doesn\u0026rsquo;t do sampling. A sampling specialist should perform sampling for your survey. The focus of the below discussion is not on how to properly select a replacement Y for a non-responding household X, but on: what mechanisms should be added to the questionnaire to accommodate one or the other strategy? what should be the instructions given to the field staff? what information should be prepared at the beginning of the survey? which information will be required later? how the replacements may be tracked and audited? Below we discuss different protocols that the HQ may impose for the cases when a household must be replaced. In all of the versions below, it is assumed that the field staff has made all possible efforts to convince the household to participate, but didn\u0026rsquo;t get an interview. Strategies Oversampling Suppose we could estimate (from previous survey, from pilot data, etc) that there will be an R=80% response to our survey. If we target T=10,000 completed interviews, the HQ should create then T/R=10,000/0.8=12,500 assignments. Pros Cons interviewers may proceed autonomously (communication not required), once all the assignments have been distributed among them; supervisors and HQ users don't come into play until the interviews are completed. very wasteful of resources if the response rate is not estimated precisely. Manual replacement For T targets exactly T assignments are created by the HQ. If a household is refusing to participate, it\u0026rsquo;s assignment is closed with the corresponding interview result code. A new assignment is than manually created by the HQ in replacement of the original. Pros Cons HQ may decide on the suitability of replacement, assign replacement based on the characteristics of the household being replaced; HQ may record the original household number being replaced in the new assignment, thus creating a link between the two assignments. requires communication from the interviewers to the server; requires active and responsive HQ-users. Semi-automatic replacement Daily snapshots of data are downloaded from the Survey Solutions server automatically, utilizing the API. Automatic scripts verify the interview result codes, and for all households that have refused and not replaced so far generate a new preloading file, which is then manually uploaded by an HQ user to create replacement assignments in batch mode. Pros Cons HQ may decide on the suitability of replacement (by affecting the selection algorithm at the HQ side); less manual work; original household number being replaced may be recorded in the preloading file, thus creating a link between the two assignments requires communication from the interviewers to the server; requires custom code to analyze interview results and generate new assignments. Shadow replacements For every assignment (A) that is generated as part of the sample, a second assignment is generated as a backup (B) for the case of non-response. Interviewers are instructed to proceed to A-households, and in case of non-response, to the corresponding B-household. Unused B-assignments are closed with the interview result code \u0026ldquo;unused spare assignment\u0026rdquo;. Pros Cons HQ decides on the backup for each household, potentially matching on specific known household characteristics; the household number of each original and replacement households may be recorded in the opposite assignment, creating a bi-directional link; communication between the tablets and the server is not required. twice the number of assignments circulates in the system; interviewers see what the replacement is, and may exert lower effort in the original assignment hoping to switch to the backup. Interviewer spares For all the assignments (A) in the given enumeration area the interviewer also receives a number of replacement assignments (B), usually smaller in number (for example for 10 As receives 3 Bs). When a non-response is encountered among A, the interviewer must proceed to the next available B. Unused backup assignments are closed with the interview result code \u0026ldquo;unused spare assignment\u0026rdquo;. Pros Cons communication is not required; fewer assignments than in no. 4 above; interviewers see what the replacement is, and may exert lower effort in the original assignment hoping to switch to the backup; not possible to match replacement households to the original ones based on characteristics; usually no link between the original and replacement households; difficult to monitor that the interviewers are pulling out replacements in the correct order while working disconnected. Supervisor spares For all the assignments (A) in the given enumeration area the supervisor receives a number of replacement assignments (B), usually smaller in number (for example for 10 As receives 3 Bs). Only As are distributed to the interviewers, while Bs remain assigned to the supervisor. When a non-response is encountered among As (the supervisor receives a completed assignment of type A with a non-response result code), the supervisor assigns the next available B to the same interviewer that has reported the non-response. Unused backup assignments are left in the status \u0026ldquo;assigned to supervisor\u0026rdquo;, or closed with the interview result code \u0026ldquo;unused spare\u0026rdquo; by the fictitious interviewer. Pros Cons interviewers don't know what the replacements are; generally fewer replacement assignments in the system than in no. 5 above, since the replacements are pooled across all of the interviewers of the team. communication is required; not possible to match replacement households to the original ones based on characteristics; usually no link between the original and replacement households. Sample mode + census mode The same survey is administered in sample mode and in the census mode. If an interviewer encounters a non-response, she can create a replacement assignment and enter identifying information herself. To avoid interviewer\u0026rsquo;s biases, a firm rule must be specified on how to select the replacement, e.g. \u0026ldquo;next household in order of enumeration\u0026rdquo;.

In place replacement In this strategy the questionnaire itself is modified to accommodate the replacement address. This can be done by triggering the \u0026ldquo;Replacement address\u0026rdquo; section to open when the interview result code is \u0026ldquo;non-response in target household, interview obtained from a replacement household\u0026rdquo;. Pros Cons number of assignments in the system is exactly the same as the number of targets; reliable link between the households being replaced and their corresponding replacements; post-processing may be required to generate a consistent variable for the actual location of the household being interviewed; behavioral: interviewers know the rule, and may decide to exert lower efforts to secure an interview knowing which household is next based on the replacement rule; must rely on interviewers following the rules for selecting the replacement households Discussion In every strategy outlined above where the interviewer is allowed to enter the address of the replacing household, there is a vulnerability that the interviewer will enter the replacement address incorrectly. A two-man rule may be introduced, where the interviewers are issued a checksum computed by the supervisor for a given replacement address, or a conditional section is locked until replacement is approved by the supervisor. In those strategies where the interviewers are issued the replacement assignments right away, it is possible to password-protect the assignment with an individual password (generated at HQ and visible to the supervisors, but not to the interviewers). In that case interviewers may only proceed to the replacement interviews when such password is communicated to them by their respective supervisor or an HQ-user. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know which strategy to prefer, discuss whether connectivity is expected in the enumeration areas, whether the full list of the households is available before the interviewers proceed to the enumeration areas, and other factors which will help you to shorten the list of available options. If unsure, select strategy #6 as it provides the best protection against the interviewers' biases, albeit at a cost of requiring communication. There are potentially other strategies, which extend the ones outlined above or achieve the same results using additional external media/lists/cards/maps etc. Depending on the nature of the survey, number of visits and other factors one or the other strategy may be more suitable, however the final quality of data will depend on how the replacement strategy has defended against the interviewers biases.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"April 10, 2017","objectID":"5203c489157e428e4425b8b08dce375d","section":"Questionnaire Designer","title":"Replacement strategies","type":"questionnaire-designer","url":"/questionnaire-designer/techniques/replacement-strategies/","wordcount":1466},{"content":" Dear friends of Survey Solutions, Below is an overview of the new features added in version 5.19. This update to Survey Solutions has touched all of the software components from Designer and Tester, to the data server and Interviewer’s app. We believe that these improvements (suggested in part by our users and partners) will improve the security of the application, expand its functionality, and present it in an even more user-friendly form. It is important to be aware of the new features to utilize Survey Solutions to its full potential: The logo image that is loaded to a Survey Solutions server gets downloaded to the tablets during initial setup and is visible at the login page replacing the default Survey Solutions image. Interviewers can click an “eye” button to see the password they are typing during the login procedure to make sure that it is typed correctly. Survey Solutions headquarter and supervisor users see a notification at the bottom of the screen if they are working with an older version of Survey Solutions (if a newer version has been released). Note that headquarter and supervisor users may not initiate an update themselves, but may notify the server administrator about the new release. Survey Solutions Tester app has got a new “Reload questionnaire” menu item. Testers can use this button to reload the questionnaire when any modifications to it have been made by a questionnaire Designer. This eliminates the need to search for the same questionnaire in the list of your questionnaires. Survey Solutions Designer now highlights the substitutions used for text piping inside the question text: The Survey Solutions syntax no longer allows to use references to current date and time since this creates behavior different for interviewers and supervisors. Questionnaires that have been already imported to a data server will continue to work, but new questionnaires referring to the current date and time will need to be revised to remove such a reference. An additional service file is now exported alongside the data files listing variables contained in each of the exported data files. In the complex questionnaires with multiple rosters it is sometimes not obvious where a particular variable will be placed in export, so this file can be used for reference to search by variable name. A Survey Solutions data server will generate and display a human-readable ID (interview key) for every interview that has been: created on the server in sample mode, or created on a tablet and synchronized to the server, or created on the server in web mode. The interview key has a form of NN-NN-NN-NN and allows to identify the interviews on supervisors’ and hq users’ dashboards even if the designer of the questionnaire didn’t designate any prefilled fields: Survey Solutions now collects a wealth of technical information about the interviewer’s devices and the status of the Survey Solutions software installed there. This allows the HQ users to monitor the status of the system, and do health checks on the tablets without having to contact the interviewers to inquire about the version of the OS or remaining storage space. The administrators and headquarters users should inspect the interviewer profile for typical problems (running an outdated version, low storage space, etc) before contacting Survey Solutions support team, since many problems are obvious from this information. Survey Solutions became more secure. We have listened to the feedback of our users and the industry’s best practices and introduced additional security measures, among which the following will be noted by our users: When changing own password, old password must be entered first; During login, after 5 attempts the user will need to enter a CAPCHA to prevent brute force attacks; The passwords hashing is now using a more recent and secure algorithm, and other changes.","keywords":["5.19"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"April 5, 2017","objectID":"8556940439bae99950f3c9256a0b0541","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 5.19","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-5-19/","wordcount":628},{"content":" Survey Solutions v5.22 automatically restricts the size of the images captured by the Interviewer App (see limits). The information below is applicable only if you wish to produce files even smaller than those automatically produced. Survey Solutions image (picture) question does not specify any particular size or quality of the photo to be captured with the tablet\u0026rsquo;s camera. Instead Survey Solutions captures the image supplied by a standard picture provider (typically the Camera application) installed in the OS Android. This allows Survey Solutions to benefit from controls and effects present in such a provider. Depending on the purpose of the image capture, the settings may need to be adjusted. The higher is the resolution and quality of the image, the more details it contains, but at the expense of larger picture size (in bytes). Larger images may take longer to upload from the tablet to the server, and download during export. Transferring larger images over cellular networks will generally cost more, or consume your volume quota faster. Smaller images are circulated more quickly in the system, but they may lack the image quality that is necessary for some purposes. Different image provider applications have different settings, and when several such apps are installed, the interviewer is generally asked, which one she would like to utilize: The two crucial settings most such applications provide are the resolution and compression level (also sometimes simply referred to as \u0026ldquo;quality\u0026rdquo;): Tentative recommendations Every survey is different, and may require different recommendations. Select a smaller resolution (such as 640x480 or 0.3MP) when taking images of e.g. houses, vehicles and other large items, where small details are of no significance. Select higher resolution (such as 2.3MP) when taking images of persons, families, crop fields. Select even higher resolution (3 and more MP) when capturing documents (IDs, pages of text, etc) or plant leaves (plant disease detection). Other settings In addition, other controls may be available, such as: scene (document, portrait, architecture, landscape, etc.), exposure control, flash control, image stabilization and other. The exact scope and number of such settings depend on the tablet manufacturer, OS version and application type. Some applications provide additional image processing or special effects capabilities, such as increasing sharpness, changing colors to black and white or picking existing images from the device photo gallery. Ensuring the data quality A questionnaire designer may provide multiple image type questions to capture \u0026ldquo;backup\u0026rdquo; photos, such as Photo of the house (1st attempt), Photo of the house (2nd attempt), Photo of the house (3rd attempt). Subsequently a supervisor\u0026rsquo;s question may be introduced for the supervisor to select which image is better corresponding to the guidelines of the survey. After the data is exported, an automatic script may be written to leave only one image selected by the supervisor, and removing the rest. Training implications Specific training on image taking is recommended for the enumerators if the photo collection constitutes an essential part of the survey. The interviewers must explore their devices, understand their capabilities and limitations. Such a training must cover: composition: understanding which essential details must be included into the photo (for example, take picture of the house from the side with front door, do not leave out antennae on the roof, do not cover the number on the ID with a finger, do not have more than one person in the frame, etc.) light conditions: taking images under bright/sunny or dusk/dark conditions, or with artificial lighting or a flash; focus: taking sharp photos of small and large objects, documents closeups; movement: taking photos when the object is moving, not standing (for example, livestock); stabilization: importance of holding the tablet steadily to capture sharp images. Implications for tablet requirements In addition to the training of the enumerators, the survey administrator must be cautious in selecting appropriate tablets for such a survey, and pay attention to: camera resolution/quality; presence of autofocus; presence of a flash, its effective range, and power consumption. Consent Depending on the particular circumstances a consent from the respondent must be acquired prior to capturing images, especially photos of persons and documents.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"March 16, 2017","objectID":"cdf8606f1bf8255d11b1e10421d0ee08","section":"Interviewer","title":"Setting photo size and quality","type":"interviewer","url":"/interviewer/special/setting-photo-size-and-quality/","wordcount":679},{"content":" Dear friends of Survey Solutions, Below is an overview of the new features added in version 5.18. This is a major release with big changes compared to the previous versions, and it also contains smaller fixes and improvements necessary to improve reliability, stability, and security of our application. It is important to be aware of the new features to utilize Survey Solutions to its full potential: web-interview mode; export to Stata Unicode format (Stata 14); User-requested feature: clickable GPS location; 3rd Survey Solutions Online User Group Meeting Tuesday, March 14th, 2017 9:00 am | Eastern Standard Time (New York, GMT-05:00) | 1 hr Meeting number (access code): 738 604 216 Meeting password: 6JjGtYHM JOIN THE MEETING Feature request form This form can be completed before and after the meeting to suggest a new feature for Survey Solutions. Web-interview mode The new version of Survey Solutions extends data collection modes to web surveys. The web survey mode allows collecting survey information through web interviews (CAWI). Interviewers are not part of this mode as the respondents are fully guided by the software, with which they interact through the internet. This mode is most useful when the respondents are not easily approachable, not known, or a face-to-face interview can’t be easily scheduled. For example, a link to the survey may be placed at a website, where cooperating visitors may follow this link to get to the interview form. Nothing special is required during the preparation of the questionnaire to be applied in web-interview mode. In fact any questionnaire used before may be imported and applied in web-interview mode, or a new questionnaire may be created. The designers of the questionnaires that will be applied in the web-interview mode need to be aware of the following: self-enumeration: the respondents will enter their information themselves without presence of the interviewer, hence navigation must be intuitive and clear; instructions and questions wording: the respondent will not be trained on the survey and may need more instructions and explanations relatively to the interviewers that had had a training on the survey; error messages must be clear, and give an indication of where the problem may be, and how it may be resolved; different presentation of some question types in the web interview (for example, barcode reading); interviews collected in web-survey mode may not be rejected back to the respondents. Setting up Survey Solutions web-interview mode Web-interview mode can be understood as an additional channel through which interviews arrive to the system and extends Census mode. On the Survey Setup page click on any survey that has been imported in census mode and select Web interview setup. Then select an interviewer from the list of existing interviewers:Enabling spam protection will help defend against robot-submitted data. The interviewer that has been picked up at this point is not conducting the interviews, but will receive any completed interview that has been rejected by the supervisor. When the web-interview mode has been started, a link will be shown, which can be placed on a public web page or mass-mailed to potential respondents. The web interview looks and behaves identical to the interview on a tablet:The respondents have to maintain internet connection while completing the interview to allow the data to be submitted to the server. If the interview process is interrupted for a prolonged period, the program will freeze the interview and require the respondent to confirm when she is ready to continue.If the respondent needs to interrupt an interview for a longer time, and close the program or restart a computer, she should retain her own personalized interview link, which is created when she starts responding to the questionnaire. This is displayed at the top of the page. The data entered as part of the web-interview is sent to the server immediately, so there is no Save action specifically required from the respondent. But the respondent still needs to click Complete to signify that there is nothing else she wants to add or change in the interview and it may be sent for validation and processing. Mixed mode of data collection With introduction of web interview mode, Survey Solutions CAPI software allows reaching customers not available for face-to-face interviews, but it still allows the survey administrator to decide, which part of the survey should be conducted in which mode. In some situations one may opt for a fully face-to-face survey, while in others for a fully web interviewing, yet in others a certain proportion of the interviews may be collected using one instrument, and the rest using the other. The mixed mode has many advantages, that our users will find useful. For example, one may start with an attempt to conduct a face-to-face interview, and upon a refusal offer the respondent to fill out a form in the internet. The data coming from both channels will be absorbed into the same database and exported as a whole, making it immediately available for quality control, cleaning and analysis. Some of our clients may be concerned about the effects that combining of different instruments may cause. Recall, that the questionnaire is still the same (unless another version has been created for web-interviewing intentionally), which reduces the possibility for inconsistencies. But web interviewing removes interviewer-effects and biases, which actually may be desirable. Export to Stata Unicode format (Stata 14) Starting with version 5.18 of Survey Solutions the data export to Stata produces data files saved in the format introduced with Stata v.14. The advantage of this format is explicit use of Unicode standard for string data allowing storage of characters from Cyrillic, Thai, Chinese, Khmer, and many other alphabets. Even where the Latin alphabet characters were used, the users earlier could see the missing characters instead of accented letters:No special action is required from the user to take advantage of the benefits of the new format as new datasets will be saved into this format automatically, but the users must be aware that Stata 14 will be required to open datasets produced with","keywords":["5.18"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"March 7, 2017","objectID":"ed0861416fa23e6aff11c61439ccba8b","section":"Release Notes","title":"Version 5.18","type":"release-notes","url":"/release-notes/version-5-18/","wordcount":1027},{"content":" Survey Solutions.

These reports stem from misunderstanding of some fundamental concepts of how computations are done by a computer, and not due to an actual defect of the software. Problem description Suppose you have a questionnaire containing two numeric questions X and Y, and a third question Z with an enabling condition (X*Y) == 21.6. Some of the users report that the question Z doesn\u0026rsquo;t get enabled even for the values where it seems to hold when checked manually, e.g. for values X=18 and Y=1.2 The problem is that of comparing two floating point numbers, which is never exact. This is not a Survey Solutions problem, this is how computers work in general. One will have exactly the same situation in Stata: display 18*1.2 display 18*1.2==21.6 display %21x 18*1.2 display %21x 21.6 The problem is not only of division or multiplication operations, but also of addition and subtraction: display 0.1+0.1+0.1==0.3 As the value 21.6 can\u0026rsquo;t be stored in computer\u0026rsquo;s memory exactly, it is rounded, and it is rounded to a different value when it is obtained as a result of a mathematical operation or entered directly. Same applies to almost any programming language. Links Bill Gould explains this (in the context of Stata) in a series of his blog postings here: http://blog.stata.com/2012/04/02/the-penultimate-guide-to-precision/ Examples for C# are plentiful all over internet, see e.g. here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3420812/how-do-i-find-if-two-variables-are-approximately-equals For in-depth overview of the problems associated with the floating point representation of numbers and operations on them, see the following article: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/800-7895/800-7895.pdf Recommendations for questionnaire designers In most cases ask yourself first, whether you need an exact comparison. In many cases exact comparison is not required. Where it is required, ask yourself whether the values should indeed be represented as floating point numbers, or perhaps they are integers by nature. When there is no other way, compare the floating point numbers x and y as Math.Abs(x-y)\u0026lt;$epsilon where you define a macro $epsilon as a sufficiently small number, for example 0.00000001. It is also possible to instruct C# to conduct the comparison as integers, where you know you indeed intend to compare integers: (long)x==(long)y You can find more about C# data types and their use in Survey Solutions by reading the article on data types.","keywords":["precision computation"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"February 6, 2017","objectID":"77f414a8719a3251f121ae12661a7161","section":"FAQ","title":"Comparing floating point numbers and precision problems","type":"faq","url":"/faq/comparing-floating-point-numbers-and-precision-problems/","wordcount":391},{"content":" The barcode question allows optical recognition of the following barcode types: Aztec Code Codabar Code 11 Code 25, Code 39 Code 93 Code 128 Data Matrix GS1 DataBar MSI Plessey PDF417 QR Code EAN UPC The exact type of the barcode is determined automatically during recognition and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be specified during questionnaire design.","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"February 2, 2017","objectID":"88cc87563cf2e7c9f4c85f29dcc70232","section":"Questionnaire Designer","title":"Recognized Barcode Formats","type":"questionnaire-designer","url":"/questionnaire-designer/limits/recognized-barcode-formats/","wordcount":55},{"content":" The table below summarizes some of the Survey Solutions limits.

If this happens: interviewer should immediately report this to his/her supervisor; supervisor should inspect the tablet and confirm the damage (often interviewers report tablets as broken when the tablets completely discharge and require long-press for power button to power up); supervisor should record the loss of a tablet and issue a replacement (possibly taking notes on the specifics of the devices lost and issued: model, serial number, date, interviewer name and login, circumstances of the loss, etc). interviewer should login to the new tablet issued, synchronize, and continue working. Consequences The following information is lost: data stored on the tablet that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been synchronized to the data server. The following information survives: survey assignments created at HQ and data that has been previously synchronized from the tablet, including assignments previously synchronized and rejected back to the interviewer. If the supervisor fails to inspect the tablet and confirm the damage and the tablet is later found to be working while the replacement tablet has been already introduced to the stock, the data from the old tablet will not be accepted by the system. See warnings illustrated in this article. To minimize damages from the physical damage: issue appropriate protection for the tablets (cases, bags, screen covers, etc); explain to the interviewers during training that the tablets are fragile, explain how to handle them, what to do and what not to do; synchronize tablets as often as possible to minimize the amount of data stored on the tablet that is not also sent to the server. Alternatives: Tablets usually contain few parts and are not easy to repair, especially in the field conditions. In some cases if the battery fails the tablet could still be powered up from an external battery or an external power source. This could help prevent loss of data on the tablet by letting it to synchronize one last time (in that case all started assignments must be declared as completed so that they are transferred to the server). Some tablets allow replacements of the screen when it is damaged. Such alternatives are usually expensive, require careful planning and can\u0026rsquo;t be conducted in the field. It is universally cheaper to repeat the interviews than to attempt a forensic recovery of the remnants of the data from a damaged tablet.

Export Encryption This group of settings contains settings that control the encryption of the data archive produced when exporting the data from Survey Solutions. When enable encryption checkbox is checked, the produced data zip-archive will be encrypted with a password that the administrator sees in the settings. To ensure high level of security the password can\u0026rsquo;t be typed in, but is generated using a random password generation algorithm to make sure the password is sufficiently complex. The administrator may request a different password to be generated by pressing the circular arrows button. There is no way of setting a specific password in this field. Default = disabled The field password must be populated with a valid password for encryption to take effect. There is no default password. To ensure the password is strong, the program generates one automatically. A new password can be generated by clicking on the refresh button.

You will see a message Note saved on successful update or deletion of the global note. User Profile Settings This group contains a single setting that controls whether the interviewers may update their contact information. default = off By default the interviewers may not update their contact information (such as email address or phone number). To allow interviewers to update their contact information - set the checkbox to checked state. To disallow interviewers to update their contact information - set the checkbox to unchecked state. Interviewer/Supervisor application settings This group contains the Interviewer/Supervisor application settings centrally controlled from the server by the administrator. Enable automatic updates determines whether only the most recent version of the App (as installed on the server) may be utilized by the workforce to exchange data with the server. default = on By default only the most recent version of the app is permitted to exchange the data with the server. Users of all earlier versions are required to update to permit synchronization. To always require the tablets to update to version of Survey Solutions as installed on the server, set the checkbox to checked state. To permit the tablets to exchange the data with the server from earlier versions of Survey Solutions, set the checkbox to unchecked state. This setting is only a recommendation. If Survey Solutions determines that e.g. the newly imported questionnaire has features not supported by the version installed on the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s tablet, it will still require to update.

Filtering answer options can help improve data quality so that an interviewer cannot select answer options that are either impossible or highly unlikely. For example, for a question where the interviewer has to select the household member\u0026rsquo;s father, you can filter the answer options so that anyone that is younger than the household member will not be displayed. Using filtered answer options You can define a filter to describe the conditions under which answer options will be displayed to the interviewer via the Filter field. Linked questions can also include a filter. In food consumption modules, questionnaire designers can limit answer options to those that make sense for each food item (e.g., weight units for solids, volume units for liquids). In demographic modules, you can filter a linked question that lists potential owners of the household’s dwelling to the set of age relevant household members. The Filter field contains a condition that is evaluated against each potential answer option. When the condition is true for a particular answer option, that answer option is displayed. When the condition is false (or yields an exception), that option is not displayed in Interviewer. In other words, the feature functions like an enabling condition for answer options, enabling only those answer options that satisfy the filter condition. Syntax There are also two system generated variables that are only available in the Filter field. For non-linked questions, the keyword @optioncode provides a way to refer to the answer options for the current question. For linked questions, the keyword @current, used as a variable prefix, allows you to differentiate between the value of a variable for current roster row and that for all other rows in the current roster. Example A question asks the interviewer to select the member in the household is the respondent\u0026rsquo;s mother. For this, you would want to filter the household members according to the following criteria: Do not show the current person Only show household members that are female Only show household members that are at least 10 years older than the household member currently being interviewed This question is a single select linked to the household roster. For this example, assume that the variable for the gender of the household member is gender and for age is age. You would write the filter for the answer options to look like this: /* Filtered answer options feature */ // Show only females gender==2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; // Cannot select his/herself as mother @current.@rowcode!=@rowcode \u0026amp;\u0026amp; // And person's age is 10 years older than current person's age age \u0026gt;= (@current.age + 10) To see an example of this code in the public questionnaire, see this question.","keywords":["syntax","filtered answer options","@optioncode","@current"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"December 2, 2016","objectID":"7016079f448c9a3802081230af2b4214","section":"Syntax Guide","title":"Syntax Guide: Filtered Answer Options","type":"syntax-guide","url":"/syntax-guide/questions/syntax-guide-filtered-answer-options/","wordcount":474},{"content":" Two types of multi-select questions There are two types of multi-select questions. They differ not only in the way they appear, but in the way their answers can be referenced with Survey Solutions' conditions language. Click below on the type of multi-select question that interests you: Series of tick boxes Series of yes/no questions Series of tick boxes Technical introduction When the interviewer answers a multi-select question, the answers are stored in an array. To make this abstract statement more concrete, take an example. In the figure, the selected items are: maize (1) and ground bean (27). Thus, the array of answers can be represented in this way: ag_d20 = {1,27} Where the array contains the values of the items selected\u0026ndash;that is 1 and 27 Common tasks Find a particular value Contains. Checks whether the answers to question contain a specified value. ContainsOnly. Contains only the specified value Look for several values ContainsAll. Check whether the answers contain all of the specified values. ContainsOnly. Contains only the specified values ContainsAny. Contains at least one of the specified values !ContainsAny. Contains none of the specified values. See the second example of ContainsAny Count the number of values Length. Computes the number of answers to a multi-select question. Syntax explained Contains Syntax tickBox.Contains(a) Description Checks whether the value a is among the answers to a tickBox\u0026ndash;that is, is contained in the set of answers. Returns true if a is contained in tickBox\u0026rsquo;s answers. Returns false otherwise. Example Often, the questionnaire designer wants to trigger certain behavior if a particular answer option is among those selected. In the example below, the interviewer needs to write a text description for the use of a loan/credit if \u0026ldquo;other (specify)\u0026rdquo; is one of the three answers recorded. To put this in terms closer to the programming language solution, the questionnaire developer enables a text question if the code for \u0026ldquo;other (specify)\u0026rdquo; (10) is contained in the array of answers to the multi-select question. In code: // enable text field to specify if \u0026quot;other\u0026quot; selected (among potentially other options) hh_p10.Contains(10) ContainsOnly Syntax Single-value version: tickBox.ContainsOnly(a) Multiple-value version: tickBox.ContainsOnly(a,b,c,...) Description Checks whether the value a (a,b,c,\u0026hellip;) is (are) the only answer(s) to tickBox. Returns true if a (a,b,c,\u0026hellip;) is (are) the only answer(s). Returns false otherwise. Example With multi-select questions, multiple answers are allowed. However, in some cases, two (or more) answers cannot be (logically) selected at the same time. That is, some answers may be mutually exclusive. Consider the example below where the answer set includes several sources for start-up capital as well as \u0026ldquo;No start-up cost\u0026rdquo;. Clearly, if \u0026ldquo;No start-up cost\u0026rdquo; is selected, some other option cannot also be selected. The contrapositive is also true: if a non-\u0026ldquo;No start-up cost\u0026rdquo; option is ticked, \u0026ldquo;No start-up cost\u0026rdquo; cannot also be ticked. Translating intention to code, we can describe the valid set of answers to this multi-select question: // either \u0026quot;No start-up cost\u0026quot; not selected... !hh_n08.Contains(13) || // ...or \u0026quot;No start-up cost\u0026quot; is the only answer provided hh_n08.ContainsOnly(13) Note: ContainsOnly also allows either a single value or multiple values to be specified. We leave to the reader the task of finding an appropriate example for using the multi-value version of ContainsOnly ContainsAll Syntax tickBox.ContainsAll(a,b,c,...) Description Checks whether the values a,b,c,\u0026hellip; are all contained in the set of answers to tickBox. Returns true if a,b,c,\u0026hellip; are all selected answers to tickBox. Returns false otherwise. Example Using Contains allows one to determine whether a certain answer is contained in a multi-select question\u0026rsquo;s array of answers. To check for more than one answer, one would need to write something like the following // the multi-select contains answers 4 and 5 multiSelect.Contains(4) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; multiSelect.Contains(5) To do the same in more compact form, one could also write the following: // the multi-select contains all of the listed answers: 4 and 5 multiSelect.ContainsAll(4,5) ContainsAny Syntax tickBox.ContainsAny(a,b,c,...) Description Checks whether any of the values a,b,c,\u0026hellip; are contained in the set of answers selected for tickBox. Returns true if any of a,b,c,\u0026hellip; are contained in tickBox\u0026rsquo;s answers. Returns false otherwise. Example Sometimes, the questionnaire designer wants to implement the same behavior when one of several answers is selected\u0026ndash;that is, if any element in a list of answers is contained in a multi-select question\u0026rsquo;s array of answers. To make this abstract situation concrete, consider the excerpt from an agricultural questionnaire below. Looking at the list of answer options, it is clear that the interviewer must specify a crop whenever an \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; option is selected. Several crops have other options: tobacco (10), groundnuts (16), rice (26), and other crops (48). To do this, the there are two options. The first option: // enable a text question if any \u0026quot;other\u0026quot; option is selected crops.Contains(10) || crops.Contains(16) || crops.Contains(26) || crops.Contains(48) The expression is valid. It does what we want. But it is inelegant and error-prone to write The second option: // enable a text question if any \u0026quot;other\u0026quot; option is selected crops.ContainsAny(10,16,26,48) This solution is more compact, more readable, and less prone to error. Length Syntax tickBox.Length Description Determines the length of the array of answers\u0026ndash;that is, the count of answers selected for tickBox. Example The length of a tick-all-that-apply, multi-select question yields the number of ticked answers. While this information may not seem immediately practical, it often can be surprisingly useful. For some questions, the number of answers may useful in writing enablement or validation conditions. Consider the questionnaire excerpt below: Logically, the questionnaire developer wants either \u0026ldquo;no start-up cost\u0026rdquo; to be selected, or some other answer option\u0026ndash;but never the two things at the same time. Earlier, we saw how to write this expression. Below, we revisit this example using the Length property of a multi-select question. Using Contains and ContainsOnly, we wrote: // either \u0026quot;No start-up cost\u0026quot; not selected... !hh_n08.Contains(13) || // ...or \u0026quot;No start-up cost\u0026quot; is the only answer provided hh_n08.ContainsOnly(13) Using Length we can write something similar: // if a single answer is selected, it can be any option hh_n08.Length==1 || // if more than","keywords":["syntax","multiselect","multi-select"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"November 30, 2016","objectID":"e13755ebc3faa5e27f8a11f88f11b5e1","section":"Syntax Guide","title":"Syntax Guide: Multi-select questions","type":"syntax-guide","url":"/syntax-guide/questions/syntax-guide-multi-select-questions/","wordcount":2187},{"content":" 1 answer is selected, the set of answers cannot contain \u0026quot;no start-up cost\u0026quot; (hh_n08.Length\u0026gt;1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !hh_n08.Contains(13)) Series of yes/no questions Technical introduction This type of question consists of items, and for each item of a \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;, or missing answer. When the interviewer answers an item, the data are stored in the following way. For each state of an item\u0026rsquo;s answer, there is an array. In each array, one finds value of the item(s) with that state. In other words, there are the following arrays, with the following contents: Yes. Contains the values of items with a \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answer. No. Contains items with a \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; answer. Missing. Containts the items without an answer\u0026ndash;that is, without a \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; answer. Before any item is answered, all items are in the Missing array. As items obtain \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; answers, they move to the Yes or No array. In addition to these three arrays, there is also an array All that containts the values of all items, whatever each item\u0026rsquo;s status. To make things more clear, consider the following example. In the image above, all items are answered with a \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answers are: Mortar/pestle (501), Bed (502), Chair (504), and Radio (507). The \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; answers are: Table (503), Fan (505), Air conditioner (506), Tape or CD/DVD player;HiFi (508), Radio with flash drive/micro CD (5081). Hence, the arrays are: hh_l01.Yes = {501,502,504,50 hh_l01.No = {503,505,506,508,5081} hh_l01.Missing = {} hh_l01.All = {501,502,503,504,505,506,507,508,5081} The items with a \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answer appear in the Yes array, those with a \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; in No, and the Missing array is empty, since all items were answered in this example Common tasks Find a particular value Contains. Checks whether the answers to question contain a specified value. ContainsOnly. Contains only the specified value Look for several values ContainsAll. Check whether the answers contain all of the specified values. ContainsOnly. Contains only the specified values ContainsAny. Contains at least one of the specified values !ContainsAny. Contains none of the specified values. See the second example of ContainsAny Count the number of values Length. Computes the number of answers to a multi-select question. Syntax explained Contains Syntax yesNo.ArrayName.Contains(a) Where yesNo is the variable name of a Yes/No mode mutli-select question, and ArrayName is the name of the Yes/No mode arrays (see the technical introduction for more). Description Checks whether the value a is among the values in the array ArrayName for the question yesNo. Returns true if a is contained in yesNo\u0026rsquo;s ArrayName. Returns false otherwise. Example In excerpt below, the designer wants to capture a text description if a \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; answer is recorded for the \u0026ldquo;Other, specify\u0026rdquo; item. Let\u0026rsquo;s think how this could be accomplished. First, one would need to know the code of the \u0026ldquo;Other, specify\u0026rdquo; item. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume this is 4. Then, one would need to know the where \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; answers are stored for Yes/No mode multi-select questions. According to the technical introduction, this is an array named Yes that is associated with any Yes/No mode, multi-select question. Putting together these pieces, // if the Yes array for question 19 contains \u0026quot;Other, specify\u0026quot;, then enable this question hh_n21.Yes.Contains(4) ContainsOnly Syntax Single-value version: yesNo.ArrayName.ContainsOnly(a) Multiple-value version: yesNo.ArrayName.ContainsOnly(a,b,c,...) Where yesNo is the variable name of a Yes/No mode mutli-select question, and ArrayName is the name of the Yes/No mode arrays (see the technical introduction for more). Description Checks whether the value a (a,b,c,\u0026hellip;) is (are) the only answer(s) in the array ArrayName assocatiated with the multi-select question yesNo. Returns true if a (a,b,c,\u0026hellip;) is (are) the only answer(s). Returns false otherwise. Example If the questionnaire designer wants only certain items to have \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; answers, they may use ContainsOnly. // ensure that only item 105 has a \u0026quot;no\u0026quot; answer yesNo.No.ContainsOnly(105) ContainsAll Syntax yesNo.ArrayName.ContainsAll(a,b,c,...) Where yesNo is the variable name of a Yes/No mode mutli-select question, and ArrayName is the name of the Yes/No mode arrays (see the technical introduction for more). Description Checks whether the values a,b,c,\u0026hellip; are all contained in the array ArrayName associated with the multi-select question yesNo. Returns true if a,b,c,\u0026hellip; are all selected answers to yesNo. Returns false otherwise. Example Suppose that the questionnaire designer wants to implement a validation rule about how tables and chairs are owned. The rule is as follows. If the household owns a chair, they may or may not own a chair. If the household owns a table, then they must also own a chair. A household never owns a table with a chair. To move one step closer to implementation, let\u0026rsquo;s translate this intent into pseudo-code. If the code for \u0026ldquo;chair\u0026rdquo; appears in the Yes array, then \u0026ldquo;table\u0026rdquo; may also. If the code \u0026ldquo;table\u0026rdquo; apepars in the Yes array, then \u0026ldquo;chair must also appear. And it is possible that neither item appear in the Yes array. Moving from pseudo-code to code, // either table and chair are owned together... hh_l01.ContainsAll(503,504) || // ...or a chair is owned without a table... hh_l01.Contains(504) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !hh_l01.Contains(503) || // ...or neither a table nor chair is owned !hh_l01.ContainsAny(503,504) ContainsAny Syntax yesNo.ArrayName.ContainsAny(a,b,c,...) Where yesNo is the variable name of a Yes/No mode mutli-select question, and ArrayName is the name of the Yes/No mode arrays (see the technical introduction for more). Description Checks whether any of the values a,b,c,\u0026hellip; are contained in the ArrayName associated with the Yes/No mode question named yesNo. Returns true if any of a,b,c,\u0026hellip; are contained in yesNo\u0026rsquo;s answers. Returns false otherwise. Example Consider the following questionnaire excerpt: Suppose that one wants to check that recorded asset ownership makes sense. In particular, the following rule: if a household owns basic assets, then they may or may not own luxury assets; if the household owns luxury assets, they must also own basic ones; and luxury assets cannot be owned without also owning basic assets. For this example, basic assets can be considered as the following: mortar (501), bed (502), table (503), chair (504). Luxury goods can be considered to be: fan (505), air contioner (506), and radio (507).

Using Language Integrated Query (LINQ) and lambda expressions in the C# language, we are able to code enabling and validation conditions for rosters that can both: Horizontally: Refer to the values of other variables for the current occurrence Vertically: Refer to the values of the same variable for other items in the roster In this article, we will cover the general syntax, common operators, provide a few examples on how to write enabling and validation conditions for rosters. Additionally, this article also provide links to more resources on LINQ expressions. General Syntax The general syntax for rosters is: RosterName.Operator(x=\u0026gt;x.varQuery1==1...) Item Description RosterName Name of the roster of interest to query. This is where to find the variables you are interested in. Operator Query Operator: The action that you want to be performed x Anonymous variable that captures the queried value. This is just a place holder and can be anything (eg a, b, person) x.varQuery Variable(s) of interest for the query The part of the syntax in the parentheses after the operator is called the \u0026ldquo;lambda expression.\u0026rdquo; The lambda expression specifies the query criteria for the LINQ expression. The value that is returned by the statement depends on the operator used. LINQ expressions can also be used to write more complex queries to a look up table. Commonly Used Operators There are many LINQ query operators that offer a range of query capabilities like filtering, sorting, projection, aggregation, etc. The most useful LINQ operators for Survey Solutions are: All: Checks that all elements of the expression meet the query criteria. This operator returns true/false. Any: Checks that at least one element of the expression meets the query criteria. This operator returns true/false. Count: Counts the number of elements that meet the query criteria. This returns the count. FirstOrDefault: Finds the first element that meets the query criteria. this returns the first element matching the query criteria. In most cases, this will be the first row that matches the search criteria If no element matches the query criteria, then it returns null. Example 1 Assume we want to enable a section only if there are any woman 15-49 years old in the household. For this enabling condition, we will be using the following variable names: Age is the name of the variable recording the age of the household member Gender is the name of the variable recording the gender of the household member. Gender will have a value of 2 if the person is a woman (Gender==2) hhroster is the name of the roster containing the age and gender questions Using this information, we would code the enabling condition to be like this: /* Enable only if there are any women 15-49 yo in the household */ hhroster.Any(x=\u0026gt;x.Gender==2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; x.Age\u0026gt;=15 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; x.Age\u0026lt;=49) In words, the expression above says: in the hhroster roster, look to see if there is any household member who is a woman and is between the age of 15 and 49 years old. Since we used the operator Any, this expression will return true if there are any woman 15-49 years old in the household. It will return false if there are none. If instead we wanted to count the number of women 15-49 years old in the household, then we would use the Count operator. Example 2 We want to check that the household contains one and only one household head. This is a common validation in many household surveys. For this approach, we would like to flag an error in the following cases: There is more than one household head There is no household head We will be using the following variable names: relat is the name of the variable name of the question recording the relationship to the household head. relat will have a value of 1 if the person is the household head (relat==1) hhroster is the name of the roster containing the questions about the household member Since Designer allows for more than one validation conditions for each question, we will write a separate validation condition for each case so that we can provide more detailed error messages to the interviewers. Case 1. There is more than one household head For this case, we want to check that another person has not been listed as the household head if a household member has been identified as the household head. We will use the conditional expression operator to code this validation. It would be coded like: // Is this person the household head? relat==1 ? // If household head, check that there is only one household head listed (hhroster.Count(x=\u0026gt;x.relat==1)==1) // If not a household head, then do not do anything : true hhroster.Count(x=\u0026gt;x.relat==1) will return the number of household heads currently listed in the roster. Because we used a conditional expression, relat==1? makes it so that it will only check that there is only one head if the current person was recorded to be a household head. If the person is not listed as a household head, then no error will be flagged. Case 2. There is no household head For this case, we only want to run this check after question about the relationship to head has been answered for everyone because this validation will trigger for every person until the household head is listed. Similarly, we will use the conditional expression operator to code this validation. It would be coded like this: // Has relationship to head been answered for all household members? hhroster.All(x=\u0026gt;x.relat!=null) ? // If all information has been filled out, check for a head was listed !(hhroster.Count(x=\u0026gt;x.relat==1)==0) // If all information has not been filled, do not do anything : true hhroster.All(x=\u0026gt;x.relat!=null) checks that relationship to head of household has been filled out for every member. If that is true, then !(hhroster.Count(x=\u0026gt;x.relat==1)==0) will count the number of members that are listed as a household head and check that the number of household heads listed is not","keywords":["designer","syntax","rosters","linq"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"November 21, 2016","objectID":"796de930e9162b6d17628b1c03ceec21","section":"Syntax Guide","title":"Syntax Guide: Using LINQ Expressions for Conditions in Rosters","type":"syntax-guide","url":"/syntax-guide/cslanguage/syntax-guide-using-linq-expressions-for-conditions-in-rosters/","wordcount":1092},{"content":" equal to 0.

Example 1 Assume there is a question (dateDeath) in your survey that asks for the date that a household member died. We want to check that the date selected is equal or after the household members date of birth. For this check, we would write the validation condition for the question like this: Self\u0026gt;=dateBirth It can also be written using the variable name: dateDeath\u0026gt;=dateBirth InRange Description Checks if a value falls within a specified range. Syntax var.InRange(a,b) This function will return true if a ≤ var ≤ b. Otherwise, it will return false. The values of a and b can either be numbers or variables. This function provides a more simple way to write the condition: var ≥ a \u0026amp;\u0026amp; var ≤ b Example 1 Assume there is a question (dateMarriage) that asks for an individuals date of marriage. We want to check that the date selected is after the individual’s date of birth, but before the date of death. For this check, we would write the validation condition for the question like this: dateMarriage.InRange(dateBirth,dateDeath) FullYearsBetween Description. Computes full years between an earlier and later date. Syntax. FullYearsBetween(dateA, dateB) This function will compute the full years between dateA and dateB. The values dateA and dateB can be either date variable or a defined new date. Example 1 Assume there is a question (dateGraduation) that asks for the respondents date of high school graduation. We want to check that respondent was greater than or equal to 18 at their high school graduation. For this check, we would write the validation condition for the question like this: FullYearsBetween(dateBorn, dateGradudation)\u0026gt;=18 FullYearsSince Description. Computes full years between a later date with an earlier date. Syntax. dateB. FullYearsSince(dateA) This function will compute the full years since dateA to dateB. The values dateA and dateB can be either date variable or a defined new date. Example 1 Assume there is a question (dateMarriage) that asks for the respondent’s date of marriage. We want to check that respondent was greater than 15 when he/she married. For this check, we would write the validation condition for the question like this: dateMarriage.FullYearsSince (dateMarriage)\u0026gt;15 CenturyMonthCode Description. Computes elapsed time in months with Century Month Code(CMC). Syntax. CenturyMonthCode(dateMonth,dateYear) This function will compute the months from dateYear to dateMonth. Example 1 Assume there is a question ageMonths that asks for an additional detail—months past the full years recorded (ageFullyears), for the age of household members, which are 5 years old and younger. We want to make sure that the additional months reported in ageMonths is consistent with the number of months calculated from the dateMonth and dateYear questions that capture the household members date of birth. For this check, we will need to implement the following: ageMonths = age in months – (12*age in years) Therefore, the correct syntax is: self==(CenturyMonthCode(dateMonth,dateYear) - (12*ageFullyears)) You can also use the variable name: ageMonths ==(CenturyMonthCode(dateMonth,dateYear) - (12*ageFullyears)) Value.AddYears/Months/Days Description Add years, months, or days to a calendar date variable for use in a condition. Syntax varDate.Value.AddYears(numeric value) varDate.Value.AddMonths(numeric value) varDate.Value.AddDays(numeric value) This function enables you to add any number (numeric value) of years, months, or days to a calendar date variable. Example 1 Assume that you are collecting information on food consumption in the past 7 days and you want to display the recall period date in the question. The recall period can be calculated from the interview date variable (interviewDate). To do this, you would create a string variable (recall) and use the following syntax to retrieve and calculate the date for the recall period: interviewDate.Value.Date.AddDays(-7).ToString(\u0026quot;dddd, MMMM dd\u0026quot;) The format to which the date is displayed can vary, pleaser refer to this article for other possible formats. Then, in the consumption question use piping in the question text with the variable name (%recall%) to display the date calculated through the variable. Example 2 Suppose you have a follow up questions asking for the date a business enterprise began operating (operationDate) if it has been recorded in a previous question that a new business began operation in the last 12 months (lastyrstart). You want to check that the operation date recorded falls within the last 12 months using the interview date question (interviewDate). For this check, the validation condition would be: operationDate.InRange(interviewDate.Value.Date.AddMonths(-12), interviewDate) Year, Month, Day Description Retrieve the year, month, or day from a date question. Syntax qDate.Value.Year qDate.Value.Month qDate.Value.Day This function will allow you to extract the year, month, or day from a date question (qDate) for use in conditions. Example 1 Assume there is a question asking the household head for the year that they took out a loan (yearLoan).

For this check, we would write the validation condition for the question like this: dateHarvest.Value.Month==11 New DateTime Description Define a new date to use with conditions involving calendar date questions. Syntax new DateTime (year, month, day) This function enables you to define a date (Year, Month, Day) or construct a date from variables. Example 1 Assume there is a question asking when the household began the harvest(dateHarvest), and it is known that harvest could not have started before March 1, 2017. For this check, we would write the validation condition for the question like this: dateHarvest\u0026gt; (new DateTime (2017, 3, 1)) Example 2 Assume a date question is asking for the date the interview was conducted (InterviewDate), and there are three questions that asks for the year of birth (yearBirth), month of birth (monthBirth), and day of birth (dayBirth). We want to check that the birth date is prior to the date to which the interview is conducted. The validation condition for this question would be: IntervewDate \u0026gt; (new DateTime( (int) yearBirth, (int) monthBirth, (int) dayBirth )) Here we are using the prefix to “int” to change the data type to integer, which is the date question data type. IsDate Description Confirms that a date recorded is in fact a calendar date. Syntax IsDate(YearDate, MonthDate, DayDate ) This function checks that a date recorded in three variables is a valid calendar date. Returns true if a combination of the three date components makes a valid date, and false otherwise. Example 1 Assume you have a series of 3 numeric questions asking for a household members date of birth, and you want check that the date recorded is a valid date. The syntax for the validation condition would be: IsDate((decimal)YearDate, (decimal)MonthDate, (decimal)DayDate ) Date. Description Retrieve the date from a current time question. Syntax var_currentTime.Value.Date This function retrieves the date from a current time variable to compare to calendar date variable or a new DateTime. Example 1 Suppose you have a current time question at the start of the interview (interview_start), then you have a date of birth question for all household members (dob). You want to make sure that the date of birth recorded is after the interview date. For this check, we would write the validation condition for the question like this: interview_start.Value.Date\u0026gt;dob Hour. Description Retrieve the hour from a current time question. Syntax var_currentTime.Value.Hour This function retrieve the hour from a current time variable. Example 1 Suppose you have a current time question at the start of the interview (interview_start), and you want to make sure the interview is being conducted at a reasonable hour\u0026ndash; at or before 9pm. For this check, we would write the validation condition for the question like this: interview_start.Value.Hour\u0026lt;=21 AddHours. Description Compute a date by adding a number of hours. Syntax var_currentTime.AddHours(numeric value) Compute a date by adding a number of hours (numeric value) to the date (var_currentTime). Example 1 Suppose you have two current time questions, one at the start of the section(ModA_start) and another at the end of a section(ModA_end). You want to check that the module has not taken more than 1 hour to complete. We would write the validation condition for the question like this: ModA_start.Value.AddHours(1)\u0026gt;ModA_end AddMinutes. Description Compute a date by adding a number of Minutes. Syntax var_currentTime.AddMinutes(numeric value) Compute a date by adding a number of minutes(numeric value) to the date (var_currentTime). Example 1 Suppose you have two current time questions, one at the start of the section(ModA_start) and another at the end of a section(ModA_end). You want to check that the module has taken at least 10 minutes to complete.

Comparison to a value Relational Operators less than, greater than, equal to, etc. Comparison to a range InRange. Checks if the selected answer falls within a range of user-specified values. Comparison to a list of values InList. Checks whether the selected answer is among the set of enumerated values. IsNoneOf. Confirms that the selected answer is not among the set of enumerated values. Count the number of values CountValue. Counts the number of times a specified value is recorded as the answer to the set of enumerated questions. Syntax explained InRange Syntax singleSelect.InRange(a,b) Description Checks if the selected answer falls within a range of user-specified values. Returns true if a ≥ singleSelect ≥ b . Returns false otherwise. Example For numeric questions, InRange was a convenient way to determine whether a value fell within a well-defined interval. For single-select questions, the same is true. But the use case is for identifying the set of ajacent answer options that map to a certain survey behavior, for example a skip. Consider the set of questions below. For certain marital statuses, there is a follow-up question. For others, no such follow-up question is administered. // administer B20 when the household member is married (i.e., answer 1 or 2 to B19) hh_b19.InRange(1,2) When answer 1 or 2 is selected in B19, the question B20 is enabled. When any other answer is provided for B19, question B20 is disabled. InList Syntax singleSelect.InList(a,b,c,...) Description Check if the selected answer is part of the set of enumerated values. Returns true if singleSelect ∈ {a,b,c,...} . Returns false otherwise. Example 1: Where InRange would also work See the example in the InRange section above. This could also have been done with InList. // administer B20 when the household member is married (i.e., answer 1 or 2 to B19 hh_b19.InList(1,2) When the number of values in a range is small, InList may be roughly as effective a solution as InRange. When the number of values in the range is large, InRange is the better solution. Example 2: Where InList is the better choice While InList and InRange may sometimes be used interchangeably, there are moments when InList is the clear choice. See the excerpt below for such an example. Let\u0026rsquo;s describe the conditions under which question 6 is answered. If the interviewer records option 1 for question 4, then question 6 is asked. If options 4 or 5 are recorded, then question 6 is also administered. Otherwise, the interviewer skips to later questions. To summarize, then, question 6 is enabled when options 1, 4, or 5 is recorded. Or, in code: // enable question 6 when answer is 1, 4, or 5 is chosen for question 4 ag_q4.InList(1,4,5) IsNoneOf Syntax singleSelect.IsNoneOf(a,b,c,...) Description Checks that the selected answer is none of the listed values\u0026ndash;in other words, is not part of the set of enumerated values. Returns true if singleSelect ∉ {a,b,c,...} . Returns false if singleSelect ∈ {a,b,c,\u0026hellip;}. Example Often, it is easier to say what should not be, rather than what should be. Consider the following example. Follow-up questions about firewood use are asked only if the household does not use firewood as its main source of cooking fuel. Certainly, one could write the following enablement condition, identifying which answers lead the interviewer to F13. // enable F13 if one of these answers selected for F12 self.InRange(3,10) However, it may be more efficient, more compact, and more readable to write which answers will disable F13. // enable F13 if no firewood option is chosen for F12 self.IsNoneOf(1,2) CountValue Syntax CountValue(a,singleSelect1,singleSelect2,...) Description Counts the number of times the value a is selected in the set of enumerated variables (i.e., singleSelect1, singleSelect2, \u0026hellip;.). Returns the number of occurrences (as a long). Returns 0 if the value does not appear. Returns 0 if all variables are null or disabled. Example: Number of yes answers Sometimes, survey sections have not one but several screening questions. Typically, in that cases, the interviewer is asked to verify whether there is at least one \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; answer in the series of screening questions. Consider the labor module example below. Each household member is asked a series of yes/no screening questions (i.e., E06_1 - E06_6).

In Survey Solutions, you can create multilingual questionnaires directly in Designer as follows: After you are satisfied with the design of the questionnaire in the language of origin, click on the translation button in the advanced instrument panel on the left. Click on the link for downloading the questionnaire template in excel format. This file can be opened with Microsoft Excel, Open Office Calc, and other similar applications. The only fields that should be edited are in the column labeled Translation. The translator can refer to the original text on the field on the left, and type the translation in the field on the right. Answer options are placed in their own dedicated sheet, as shown below. The name of each such additional sheet is formed by prepending the variable name with a special marker “@@_”. After the translation has been completed, save the file. Then, go back to the translation panel in Questionnaire Designer and click on Upload New Translation. Select your file. Since the name of the translation file defined here will appear exactly as is, on the Interviewer Application, you may want to the edit the name listed here. To change the name, click on the text box and make the necessary edits.

It is not possible for one user to work on several devices. When the user attempts to use the second device a warning is issued that the data that belongs to this user on the previous device will discarded: \u0026ldquo;You are already assigned to another device.

Interviewers are solely responsible for any data loss that resulted from interviewers relinking their device. Important! The original device will appear functioning until the very moment of synchronization when it will contact the server for synchronization and first find out that the device has been banned from the system and no information from it will be accepted by the server. As a consequence, all the data collected since the last synchronization will be discarded. Advice: Do not let the interviewers or anyone else know the credentials of any user in the system as this may cause disruptions. Every user must work utilizing his/her assigned credentials, and interviewers must stay with the same device. Minimize the chances of devices being accidentally swapped between the interviewers (such as when storing together identical tablets with no identification marking during field trips, etc).

This function provides a more simple way to write the condition: var ≥ a \u0026amp;\u0026amp; var ≤ b Example 1 Assume there is a question (days_worked) that asks the respondent how many days in the last 7 days did they work at their primary job. We want to check that the response is between 0 and 7 days as a validation condition. For this check, we would write the validation condition for the question like this: self.InRange(0,7) It can also be written using the variable name: days_worked.InRange(0,7) Example 2 A common check for numeric questions is a range check to verify that the answer to the question is within certain bounds. To verify, for example, that year of birth is within 1900 to 2020 range we write a validation condition for this variable: self.InRange(1900,2016) InList Description Checks if a value matches any of the values in a specified list. Syntax var.InList(a,b,c,d,\u0026hellip;) This function will return true if var matches any of the arguments in the provided list. Otherwise, it will return false. The values in the list can either be numbers or variables. This function provides a more simple way to write the condition: (var==a || var==b || var==c || var==d || ...) Example 1 Assume you have a question (satisfied) that asks people to rank how satisfied they are with their life on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being very unsatisfied and 5 being very satisfied. For people that answered 1 or 5, you want to ask them additional questions so you will need to have enabling conditions for them. For the follow up questions, you would code the enabling conditions like this: satisfied.InList(1,5) Abs Description Returns the absolute value of a number. The absolute value of a real number can be thought of as the distance of the number from zero. Syntax Math.Abs(z) The value for z can be an expression, a variable or a number. If you are using a variable or an expression with multiple variables, you will have to add .Value to the end of each variable to avoid a compile error.

Syntax Math.Ceiling(z) The value for z can be an expression, a variable or a number. If you are using a variable or an expression with multiple variables, you will have to add .Value to the end of each variable to avoid a compile error. Example Math.Ceiling(3.21) // returns 4 Math.Ceiling(3.98) // returns 4 Math.Ceiling(6-3.5) // returns 3 Math.Ceiling(4-2) // returns 2 Floor Description Returns the largest integral value that is less than or equal to the value provided Syntax Math.Floor(z) The value for z can be an expression, a variable or a number. If you are using a variable or an expression with multiple variables, you will have to add .Value to the end of each variable to avoid a compile error.

The number of such files is a function of the structure of the questionnaire, meaning that exporting produces one file per level of observation in the questionnaire, or in other words in addition to one file at the questionnaire level, each roster in the questionnaire will generate another export file. For example, one file for household-level variables, one file for household member-level variables, and one file for asset-level or consumption item-level variables. Additionally, the .zip file will contain interview comments and interview actions files. Note that the exported data differentiates between missing values caused by the logic of the questionnaire (skipped questions) and missing values due to absence of an answer. Only the values of the logically skipped questions will be have missing values (blanks in tab-delimited files), whereas -999999999 or ##N/A## (for string variables) will be exported whenever an answer to a question was expected, but not recorded for string variables).

More detail is provided below about useful system variables: self, @rowcode, @optioncode, and @current. self For validation conditions, a very useful system generate variable isself. This variable denotes the value of the question being validated. Using self instead of the question\u0026rsquo;s variable name in a question\u0026rsquo;s validation conditions is advised because you will not have to change the variable name in the validation condition if the variable name for the question is changed. It is important to note that using self in the enabling condition will cause an compile error. Example: You have a question \u0026ldquo;How many rooms does this house have?\u0026rdquo; with the variable name num_rooms. If the value 0 is not an acceptable answer for this question, then you can write either num_rooms\u0026gt;0 or self\u0026gt;0 as a validation condition for this question. The two expressions are equivalent. @rowcode This system generated variable allows you to reference specific rows within a roster. This variable can be used in enabling conditions and validations. Additionally, @rowcode can also be used to refer to certain rows in a look up table. Example 1: Assume you have roster of items and you have a question that should only be asked of two of the items (item #110 and item #114). In this case, you would use @rowcode to refer to the item number. Then you would use @rowcode and write the enabling condition to be like below: Example 2: Assume you have a roster of items that the household could have bought in the last 7 days. You want to check that the amount of money spent is not too high. Two of the items on the list are matches (item# 10) and cigarettes (item #11). Cigarettes are more expensive than matches so the largest amount that could be spent would be different for each item. Assume that you want an upper bound of 20 USD for matches and 100 USD for cigarettes. Youwould use @rowcodeto code the upper bound specific to that item. To code this check, you would write the validation condition to be like below: @optioncode This system generated variable, @optioncode, is used to filter answer options for single select questions and multi-select questions. @optioncode refers to the numeric code for each answer option. Example: Assume you have a question that asks when in the past calendar year a business has been in operation. You want to filter the answer options so that only the months in the past appears. For example, if the interviewer occurs in October, you do not want the month November and December to appear because those are months in the future. Assume you have a question that captures the the date of the interview (InterviewDate). You will use date time functions to code this filter. You should write the filter to look like below: The codeInterviewDate.Value.Month takes the numeric month value from the InterviewDate variable. The filter will be evaluated for every option code and it will only display the options that it evaluate to true. In this case, months in the future will evaluate to false and will not appear as an answer option. @current This system generated variable, @current, is very useful in code to filter answer options. @current refers to the current line or occurence in the roster. For example, @current refers to the current household member that you are on in the household roster. Example: Assume you have a question that asks the interviewer to select the ID of the spouse of the current household member. You want to filter the answer options based on the following criteria: Do not show the current person Only show household members of the opposite gender Only show household members 10 years old or greater This question is a single select linked to the household roster. For this example, assume that the variable for the gender of the household member is gender. You would write the filter for the answer options to look like this: To see an example of this code in a public questionnaire.","keywords":["syntax","beginner","self","@rowcode","@optioncode","@current"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"August 16, 2016","objectID":"9cffa85391f2f2885c1c107787878797","section":"Syntax Guide","title":"Syntax Guide: System Generated Variables","type":"syntax-guide","url":"/syntax-guide/cslanguage/syntax-guide-system-generated-variables/","wordcount":699},{"content":" Designer has built-in operators that can be used in enabling conditions or validations. This article explains the following operators that you can use in your instrument: Arithmetic operators Relational operators Logical operators Other useful operators Arithmetic Operators The following table shows the arithmetic operators supported by Survey Solutions. Arithmetic expressions are evaluated from left to right. For the example, assume A = 20 and B = 10 Operator Description Example + Addition: returns the sum A + B = 35 - Subtraction: returns the difference A - B = 10 * Multiplication: returns the product A * B = 200 / Division: returns the quotient B / A = 2 % Modulus: returns the remainder after an integer division B % A = 0 (The remainder of 20 divided by 10 is 0) Relational Operators These operators compare two values and return either TRUE or FALSE. The following comparison operators are supported by Survey Solutions: Operator Description Example == Checks if the two values are equal. If values are equal, then the condition is true 20 == 10 returns FALSE != Checks if the two values are not equal. If the values are not equal, then the condition is false 20 != 10 returns TRUE \u0026gt; Checks if the left value is greater than the right value 20 \u0026gt; 10 returns TRUE \u0026lt; Checks if the left value is less than the right value 20 \u0026lt; 10 returns FALSE \u0026gt;= Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value 20 \u0026gt;= 10 returns TRUE. 10 \u0026gt;= 10 returns TRUE. \u0026lt;= Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value 20 \u0026lt;= 10 returns FALSE. 10 \u0026lt;= 10 returns TRUE.

In Survey Solutions we always do this behind the scenes for the users, so when an exception occurs: In enabling condition the question is considered disabled, and In validation condition the answer is considered invalid.

The interviewer should thus do everything within their power to ensure that all questions are answered. The interviewer application offers three ways to do this. The first is the classic method that one might use with a paper questionnaire. The interviewer simply flips the questionnaire looking for unanswered questions or answers that have triggered red error messages. The second, which concerns completeness, is to use the navigation panel as a gauge of whether any questions still need to be answered. Each element in the navigation panel is color-coded. Green indicates that a section is complete—that is, that all questions have been answered and none have invalid answers. Blue denotes incomplete—that is, that some question are unanswered. Red indicates that one or more questions in the answer have an invalid answer—that is, an answer that violates the validation condition. The third method is to navigate to the module on the navigation pane named Complete. Once on that screen, the number of unanswered and invalid questions are displayed. The interviewer can identify the unanswered questions by opening the navigation pane (as described above), and navigate to errors flagged by pressing on each one on the Complete screen. Checking that all answers are valid In addition to confirming that a questionnaire is completely answered, the interviewer must also make sure that all answers make sense. There are two complementary ways of doing this. While completing the questionnaire, the interviewer will see error messages whenever the answers provided are invalid. An invalid answer may be one that is outside of some expected range (e.g., age should be between 0 and 100) or one that conflicts with an answer provided elsewhere (e.g., age conflicts with date of birth). The interviewer should, to the extent possible, correct any errors as soon as they arise. After completing the questionnaire, the interviewer should check that no errors have escaped his/her attention. To do this, the interviewer can follow the same protocol as in the third method above for confirming that all questions have been answered. Marking an interview as complete An interview is not automatically complete once all of the answers have been answered. To mark a questionnaire as complete, the interviewer must use the navigation pane to navigate to the module named Complete. Once on that screen, the interviewer then needs to click on the Complete button. This will mark the questionnaire as complete and be reflected in the status of that assignment on the interviewer’s Dashboard.","keywords":["check","review","complete","interviewer","app","application"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"July 14, 2016","objectID":"b78c54b3670d9734500ac0f41f50b1c7","section":"Interviewer","title":"Quality Control \u0026 Marking Interviews as Complete ","type":"interviewer","url":"/interviewer/app/quality-control-marking-interviews-as-complete-/","wordcount":423},{"content":" Overall Interviewers should strictly follow the survey protocol for administering a questionnaire (e.g. asking earlier questions before later questions, completing earlier modules before later modules), but may occasionally need to move around the questionnaire for good reasons (e.g. review their work, move between rows of the roster if the respondent corrects an earlier answer, administer an independent module when the key respondent for that module is present). The interviewer can move around questionnaires in several ways. Within a section Swiping up and down moves within a single group of questions (e.g., a module). Between sections at different hierarchical levels Within any given module, the interviewer may use breadcrumbs, represented as links at the top of the screen, to move between different groups of questions and sub-sections of the module. Like the breadcrumbs in the fable of Hansel and Gretel, these pieces of the interface are meant to help the interviewer find their path back to where they were in the interview (e.g., moving out of a sub-section and into the main module). To see this, consider the image below. The interviewer is currently in a group of questions about the Plot 2 (the title shown at the top of the section). That group of questions falls within Parcel Roster-By the river (the next breadcrumb), which itself falls inside the Parcel, Plot, and Crop Details module. If the interviewer wanted to move from the Plot 2 section to the Parcel Roster-By the river section, they could simply click on the Parcel Roster-By the river breadcrumb. If the interviewer wanted to move to the main part of the Parcel, Plot, and Crop Details module from either the Parcel Roster-By the river or the Plot 2 sections, they would only have to tap on the Parcel, Plot, and Crop Details breadcrumb.

As an interviewer, you must know how to answer each of them. To help you with that text, each question type is briefly explained below with visual aids. Numeric Questions that take a numeric response have a field for an open numeric answer. When that field is tapped, the numeric keyboard appears so that the interviewer can compose an appropriate numerical response. Text Text questions have a field for an open text response. When that field is tapped, the text keyboard appears so that the interviewer can compose an appropriate text response. Categorical: Single-Select Single-select categorical questions have answer options with radio buttons. To answer this type of question, the interviewer taps the radio button associated with the most appropriate answer. Categorical: Multi-Select Multi-select categorical questions have answer options with check boxes. To answer this type of question, the interviewer taps in all appropriate check boxes. Selected answers will show a check in the box. Categorical: Multi-Select in Yes/No Mode Multi-select categorical questions in yes/no mode have two radio buttons for each item\u0026ndash;one that denotes “yes” and another that denotes “no”. To answer this type of question, the interviewer taps the radio button associated with the most appropriate answer for each item. Categorical: Cascading Selections When unanswered, cascading selections look similar to text or numeric questions. Each question has a field where an answer can be composed. However, to answer these questions, the enumerator first taps in the field and then selects the most appropriate categorical answer from a drop-down menu. Selecting an answer option can be done either through tapping an option directly or through typing to narrow down answer options and then select the most appropriate. List Tap on the empty text box and use the keyboard to input an answer. Additional, elements can be added to the list until the maximum allowable number of items is reached. To delete elements from the list, click on the X mark. However, be careful: doing so may result in deleting data, if the elements of a list question are linked to a roster (e.g., names of household members, each of which has their own row in the household demographics roster). Date First, tap on the enter date textbox. Then, use the pop-up window to input the correct date. Depending on which is more convenient, the interviewer may either scroll elements of the date up and down (i.e., use the left-hand component of the date input in the image below) or pick the date from the calendar (i.e., use the right-hand component of the date input dialog). After clicking the Done button, the date will be recorded. The recorded answer will be displayed below the question text, as pictured above. Date: Current Time Tap on the Tap to record current time box. Then, the current time on the tablet will automatically be recorded. GPS First, tap on the textbox. This will open a window informing you that the tablet is searching for the GPS location. Closing this window will stop the tablet from searching for GPS. Then, the tablet automatically records the GPS coordinates. The GPS location is displayed immediately below the question text, showing the longitude, latitude, accuracy, and altitude. If GPS reading is not accurate enough, you may tap on the record GPS textbox again. Doing so will replace the old GPS reading with the new GPS reading. You can continue in this fashion until you obtain and adequately precise GPS reading. Barcode First, tap on the textbox. Then, point the tablet’s camera towards the barcode, trying to align the red bars with the barcode, as above. Once the tablet can clearly read the barcode, the camera will turn off and the barcode’s value will appear just below the question text. Picture First, tap on the take a photo textbox. Then, point the tablet’s camera to compose your picture, pressing the camera icon on screen to take the picture. Once the picture has been taken, press the check button to accept the picture or the X button, as pictured above, to reject the picture and replace it with another picture.

First, the question shows some answer. Second, the tablet vibrates and the questions are surrounded by a red outline, if the recorded answer is not valid. Vibration can be disabled by navigating to Interviewer\u0026rsquo;s settings and removing the checkbox next to Vibrate when invalid answer is given. However, even after a question is answered, an interviewer may want to wait before moving to the next question. When the interviewer needs to pause, the Interviewer application will display the following message: An interviewer can recall an answer in any question by clicking on the X next to their response. How to know if you have made a mistake After an answer is recorded, the Interviewer application automatically assesses whether the answer is consistent with other answers in the questionnaire or plausible based on what is known about the survey population. If an answer is inconsistent or implausible, that answer is considered invalid. Questions with invalid answers are outlined in red (The tablet will also vibrate if the feature is enabled), and accompanied by an error message will appear describing the problem (as shown above). Understanding groups and rosters Groups and rosters are special grouping of questions. On the tablet, both first appear as a button. When the button is tapped, the interviewers see the questions or roster row associated with that button. To exit the roster row, the interviewer must select the button containing the name of the roster group or section at the bottom of the screen. To complete a group or roster, the interviewer simply answers all relevant questions. For a group, this is simple. For a roster, the process merits some explanation. An interviewer must complete a roster row by row. By tapping on the button associated with any given row, the interviewer will see all questions for that item in the roster.

To do so, click on the Language drop down menu on the left most menu and choose another language. Navigate **The user interface for the interview details matches the Interviewer application. ** To make interview content clear, the interview details view renders questions and their answers just like the Interviewer application. In that way, Headquarters and Supervisors users see what Interviewer users do. To navigate through the questionnaire content, use the the navigation pane with on the left with the list of the sections and subsections. This looks similar to the Tester/Interviewer applications. The different colors will indicate completion status of sections similar to the Interviewer application.Click on the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; sign next to the left of a section, subsection, or roster to expand the element to navigate directly to an item in that section, subsection or roster. Filters The supervisor can further navigate through the questionnaire by using the filters on the left most pane. The filters that are available are: With comments, Flagged, No flag, Invalid, Valid, Answered, Not answered, For supervisor, For interviewer. You can select multiple filters. The With comments and flagged filters display those questions with comments or flags, respectively. The invalid filter displays those questions that failed a validation check (e.g., range, consistency with other responses, etc.). The Answered questions, as the name suggests, are all those that have an answer. The Unanswered questions are those that do not have an answer. The For supervisor’s filter yields those special questions that only the supervisor can see and are supposed to answer. The *For interviewer *filter shows all the questions that the interviewers are supposed to record responses for. This will be the majority of questions. The number in the parentheses next to each filter indicates how many questions in the interview for which that filter applies. Clicking on a filter will show a list of the filtered questions on the right for which the filter is true. For example, if you selected the \u0026ldquo;Invalid\u0026rdquo; filter, then you will see all the questions in the interview where there is an error. Clicking on the question in the right pane will take you to the question of interest. To reset all the filters and see all the questions in the interview, click on the View all (reset all filters) link below all the filters. Add a flag The supervisor will have review large amounts of information in each questionnaire. Flags enable the supervisor to mark a particular question as a place to return later, perhaps when comparing the consistency of an answer in an early module of the questionnaire with an answer in a much later module of the questionnaire. The supervisor can see these flagged fields quickly, as explained above, by clicking on the Flagged filter in the left most pane on the screen. To add a flag, navigate to the question where you want to leave a flag, moving your cursor to the top left-hand side of the screen. Then, click on the flag icon. Once a flag has been added, the supervisor can click on the flagged filter to see the field or fields bearing a flag. Add comments Comments left by the interviewer will appear in pink text. The supervisor can leave a comment for any question for the interviewer. To leave a comment, click on the gray 3-dots on the top right corner of the question of interest and then select \u0026ldquo;Add comment.\u0026rdquo; A box at the bottom of the question will appear and the supervisor can then type in a comment for the interviewer in the box. After the supervisor finishes typing the comment, then he/she can then either press the** *Enter*** key on the keyboard or click on the \u0026ldquo;Post\u0026rdquo; button to add the comment. The supervisor can post multiple comments to any question. After they can be added, comments cannot be deleted but they can be hidden using the gray 3-dots on the top right corner of the question. Approve, Reject After reviewing the questionnaire, the supervisor should approve or reject the questionnaire based on the quality of the data collected by the interview. The supervisor will use the buttons in the left most pane to approve or reject the interview. To approve, click on the green Approve button; to reject, the red Reject button. Whichever button is selected, a pop up confirmation screen will appear with the opportunity to provide comments on the questionnaire as a whole. At this confirmation screen, click on the blue OK to confirm your approval or rejection. Click on the CANCEL button to go back to the interview details screen. Make sure you are sure of your decision before proceeding. There is no way to un-approve or un-reject a questionnaire unless it is rejected by Headquarters.

They facilitate the display of questions that may be of interest to the supervisor. The All filter presents all questions. The commented and flag** **filters display those questions with comments or flags, respectively. The *answered* questions, as the name suggests, are all those that have an answer. The *invalid* filter displays those questions that failed a validation check (e.g., range, consistency with other responses, etc.). The *supervisor’s* filter yields those special questions that only the supervisor sees and can answer. The *enabled* and* hidden* filter returns questions that are available to be answered based on the skip logic of the questionnaire and answers provided to key questions.

The login name must be between 3 and 15 characters long, and may contain only letters, digits and the underscore symbol. The letters must be from Latin (English) alphabet only: 'A'..'Z' or 'a'..'z'. Other letters (Cyrillic, Arabic, etc.) are not valid for usage in login names. PasswordThe password to the user account. The password is case-sensitive. An account password must satisfy the following complexity requirements: be at least 10 characters long, letters from non-Latin alphabets (Cyrillic, Arabic, etc.) may be included in the password, include at least one digit ('0'-'9'), include at least one uppercase ('A'-'Z') letter, include at least one lowercase ('a'-'z') letter. RoleThe Survey Solutions user role assigned to the newly created user account. It is one of the following words: Supervisor, Interviewer. The spelling of the role is case-insensitive. SupervisorThis value must only be specified for interviewer accounts and denotes the login-name of the supervisor, to whose team this interviewer account is added. The spelling of the supervisor's login-name is case-insensitive. Optional fields FullnameReal full name of the user that receives this account. Person's name must be no longer than 100 characters and may only consist of letters, dots, spaces, and apostrophes. EmailEmail address of the user that receives this account. An email address must conform to the rules of email addresses. Invalid email addresses may not be stored. PhonenumberPhone number of the user that receives this account. The phone number must be numeric and no longer than 15 digits. Note that the fields login, password and role are mandatory, and must be filled out for every user in the list.

The columns capture details about survey cases, such as the respondent’s address, interview status, and an indicator that the interviewer has or has not received the survey case. Filters for querying the database. The database can be filtered to show only the survey cases of interest—for example, those with a particular status or those done by a particular supervisor. **Toolbar with a Delete, Approve, and Reject button. **Survey cases can be deleted, approved, or rejected individually or as a group by selecting the check box next to each case. The toolbar will appear if one or more cases have been selected. If you would like to select all the survey cases displayed on that page, click on the first check box at the top of the list. Interview Key. This is a system generated random number for each survey assignment. Completed survey cases can be reviewed in detail by clicking on the interview key for that case. This will open another interface that will be discussed below. Search bar to navigate through the survey cases quickly. Search for survey cases The Interview tab contains a detailed list of survey cases— those that have been completed, those that supervisors have approved and sent for headquarters’ review. The details can be used to search for particular survey cases. The interview panel in the lower right-hand quadrant of the screen presents a list of interviews and information about them—where the respondent is located (Identifying Questions), which supervisor is responsible (Responsible), when the assignment was last updated (Last Updated), how many errors the interview contains (Errors), what status the interview has (Status), whether the interviewer has received the assignment (Received by Interviewer), and in the case of census mode surveys whether the case has been created on the device by the interviewer (Created on Client). There are three mechanisms for finding a survey. The first is by clicking on the arrow associated with any column of the information in the lower right-hand quadrant. This will sort the list of surveys in ascending (^) or descending (v) order by that chosen column. The second mechanism is through the filters located on the left-hand side of the screen. To narrow down the list of survey cases, headquarters may filter by the questionnaire (Questionnaire), team member responsible (Responsible), the status of the interview (Status), and/or the assignment of the interview. The third mechanism is through the search field located in the toolbar. Use keywords to narrow down the list of survey cases. The following are searched: values of identifying questions; Interview keys Interview IDs. The search term must appear from the start of the value. If the search term appears in the middle or end of the value, it will not be matched. For example, if you are searching for 321 the following records will match: ENUMERATION AREA: 3218 ADDRESS: 1064 Main str. ENUMERATION AREA: 1800 ADDRESS: 3212 Freedom Ave. And the following will not match: ENUMERATION AREA: 3118 ADDRESS: 1321 Main str. ENUMERATION AREA: 5216 ADDRESS: 1064 Main str., apt 321 Reallocate survey cases between teams Survey cases will need to be reallocated when a new team is created and needs to take over some of the work from existing teams. Cases can be reassigned by a Headquarter user from one team to another. Reassignment is possible when the interview is in any status except the following two: “ApprovedByHeadquarter” and “ApprovedBySupervisor”. To reassign cases, select the check boxes for the cases you wish to reassign, and click on the green assign button. Review survey cases The questionnaire review interface consists of five components: Navigation pane. Displays a table of contents for the questionnaire, where you can use each entry in this pane to see a particular part of the questionnaire. Clicking on the top entry, the name of the questionnaire, brings the full questionnaire back into focus. Filters. These boxes can be used to see questions that have certain attributes—for example, comments or flags. Questionnaire review pane.

These buttons determine whether a questionnaire returns to the supervisor or is integrated into the final data set. **Language dropdown menu. **If the questionnaire is a multilingual questionnaire, the user can toggle between languages using this menu. **Flags. **Questions can be marked during the review process. Use the filters (2) to only show the questions that have been flagged. Headquarters plays a critical quality control role in the Survey Solutions workflow. Supervisors supervise enumerators, reviewing questionnaires the latter completes. Headquarters supervises supervisors, reviewing the questionnaires the latter approves. To do this, first headquarters clicks on the Interview Key associated with any questionnaire whose status is ApprovedBySupervisor. Then, headquarters reviews the questionnaire for completeness, consistency, and plausibility of answers using the questionnaire review interface. The questionnaire pane, located in the middle of the screen, contains the questions and their answers. Groups, on the left-hand part of the screen, allow headquarters to see different parts of the questionnaire when any element of the pane is clicked. The top heading corresponds to the complete questionnaire. Bolded headings lead to modules (chapters) within the questionnaire. Indented headings are linked to either groups of questions or rows of rosters. Filters, arrayed atop the questionnaire pane, facilitate the display of questions that have particular attributes.

The “supervisor’s” filter yields special questions that only the supervisor sees and can answer. The “enabled” filter returns questions that are available to be answered based on the skip logic of the questionnaire and answers provided to key questions. Next, headquarters either approves or rejects the questionnaire by clicking the appropriate button. The headquarters’ choice determines whether the assignment is included in the survey database (Approve) or returned to the supervisor for correction (Reject). To unapprove any interview in the Approved by Headquarters status select this interview(s) by checking the checkbox next to it and click the Unapprove button. Alternatively, open the interview case and click on the Unapprove button on the toolbar. The interview will be reverted to the Approved by Supervisor status, and the headquarters user will have a possibility to reject it back to the supervisor if necessary. You can apply this operation to multiple interviews if necessary. Additionally, the headquarter user, has the authority to approve completed interviews directly, without waiting for the supervisor’s decision. This results in faster turnaround of the data circulating in the system in case the supervisor is swamped with work, in which case the headquarters can reduce the workload by pulling the good-quality interviews from the supervisor’s stack. There is no change in the user interface, but the button will now permit headquarters approvals of the interviews in status “Completed”. Note that you cannot reject an interview to an interviewer directly. Delete survey cases Deletion is a dangerous tool reserved for rare occasions—for example, when errors arise in survey sampling or in creating survey cases. Because deletion is dangerous, only the administrator/headquarters users have the authority to delete selected interviews. It is only allowed for interviews with the status SupervisorAssigned or InterviewerAssigned. Those with the former status have been assigned to a supervisor, but not yet assigned by the supervisor to an interviewer. Those with the latter status have been assigned to an interviewer, but have not been completed. In both cases, headquarters should exercise extreme caution. Once deleted, an interview cannot be restored. Hence, administrator should only delete interviews that have been carefully confirmed as errors to be deleted. To delete an interview, first find an eligible case. The most efficient strategy for doing so may be to filter the questionnaires based on status so that only those with status SupervisorAssigned or InterviewerAssigned appear. (See the section Search for survey cases above for more details.) Next, select the case(s) to delete by clicking in the check box to the left of the case. Make sure the correct cases have been selected before proceeding. Then, click on the Delete interview button located immediately above the interview panel.

By questionnaire template The Surveys and Statuses report summarizes the progress of each survey that headquarters is overseeing (i.e., data collection with a given template). The anatomy of the report is as follows. The column labeled “Survey Name” contains the name of each survey. The subsequent columns correspond to each possible status of a survey case in the Survey Solutions survey workflow. (For a detailed explanation of the workflow and the statuses, see the Survey Workflow article.) Each cell in the report captures the number of cases that are in a given state for a given survey (e.g., number of “Complete” assignments for “Household Roster”). By default, this report summarizes the status of survey cases over all supervisors—it reports the total sum of survey cases in each status, summing over all supervisors. This report can be filtered to provide a summary or focus on one supervisor at a time. To do this, click on the drop-down menu below Supervisors filter and select a name. Doing so will yield a summary of progress for only the selected supervisor. In other words, filtering allows headquarters to focus on the progress of an individual supervisor. By team The Team and Statuses report provides a status report for each supervisor. The first column of the report lists all supervisors under headquarters’ supervision. The subsequent columns correspond to each possible status of a survey case in the Survey Solutions workflow. Each cell captures the number of cases in a particular status for a specific supervisor. By default, the Teams and Statuses report provides a global summary of progress at the supervisor level. Headquarters can filter the report in order to obtain a more granular view of progress by questionnaire template. To do this, click on the drop-down menu located below Questionnaire. Then, select a particular questionnaire to see each team’s progress for that questionnaire alone. Doing so will generate a summary of progress for the chosen template. By status duration The Status Duration report carefully flags lack of progress. While other reports count interview cases, this report includes both assignments and interview cases. By seeing how many days interviews stay in the same status, survey managers can see whether survey operations are moving forward, and identify any bottlenecks (e.g., slow approval by supervisors, slower reactions by HQ, etc.). By clicking on any cell in the report, managers can drill down to the details of which assignments/interviewers and/or field staff are behind interviews stagnating in the same status. Headquarters can filter the report in order to obtain a more granular view of progress by questionnaire. To do this, click on the drop-down menu located below Questionnaire. Then, select a particular questionnaire to see the report for that template alone.

This will open the interface for creating this type of report Select the questionnaire you want to map from the Questionnaire drop-down menu. Select the geo-location variable from the questionnaire that you wish to plot on the map. This will plot completed questionnaires on a map, showing their geographical dispersion and providing some sense of where survey teams have and have not reached. By quantity The Quantity report tab provides the following reports for each questionnaire template: Number of completed interviews: Provides the number of completed interviews for each data collection team. Interviews that have been rejected and then completed are counted as an additional completed interview. Number of interview transactions by HQ: Provides the number of headquarters approvals and rejections for each data collection team. Number of interviews approved by HQ: Provides the number of headquarters approved interviews for each data collection team. Number of interview transactions by supervisor: Provides the number of supervisor approvals and rejections on interviews collected by each data collection team.

Workflow Description Headquarters, designated by the PC at the top of the figure, determines the subjects that need to be interviewed (households, firms, geographic area, etc.) and their assignments across team supervisors. Assignments can include one or more interview cases. Team supervisors, denoted by the laptops in the middle, first receive these assignments and then allocate them to the members of their team. Interviewers, represented by tablets, receive the assignments from the team supervisors, collect data for the cases within the assignments, and send completed cases back to supervisors for review. Team supervisors, having received completed interview cases, review these questionnaires to confirm that all questions are answered and that answers are accurate, coherent, and plausible. After reviewing these completed interview cases, team supervisors either approve or reject them. If a team supervisor approves a completed interview case received from an interviewer, the assignment is sent to headquarters, as represented by the paper with a checkmark. If a team supervisor rejects a completed assignment received from an interviewer, the assignment is returned to the interviewer initially responsible for completing it. Receiving the rejected assignment, the interviewer must either correct it or provide explanatory notes on strange or implausible answers. When the assignments are corrected, the interviewer sends them back to the team supervisor for approval or rejection, a process that continues until the assignments are completed with the highest level of quality according to the team supervisor. As an assignment moves through the survey workflow, it takes on a different status at each stage, as illustrated in the photo above. SupervisorAssigned means that Headquarters has sent the interview assignment to the supervisor. The supervisor must now take action on this assignment, allocating it to a member of their team. InterviewerAssigned means that a supervisor has allocated this assignment to a member of their team. The interviewer must now conduct an interview with the assigned member of the survey population. Completed means that an interviewer has marked an interview case as complete and has sent it to the supervisor. The supervisor must now review the questionnaire for quality and completeness, and then reject or approve the interview. RejectedBySupervisor means that a supervisor has rejected the interview and, by default, that interview returns to the interviewer who sent it. The interviewer must now address their supervisor’s concerns, making a change to the questionnaire or providing explanatory comments. ApprovedBySupervisor means that a supervisor has approved this interview and, in doing so, sent it Headquarters for further review. Headquarters must now review the interview and reject or approve it. RejectedByHeadquarters means that Headquarters has rejected the interview assignment and, thus, returned it to the supervisor that initially approved it. The concerned supervisor must now take action on the interview, providing explanatory comments or sending to an interviewer to be fixed. ApprovedByHeadquarters means that Headquarters has approved the interview case and, no further action may be taken on this final interview.","keywords":["workflow","process","headquarters","supervisor","manager"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"June 29, 2016","objectID":"40a3ebe5119c5960ecdf9284437107b7","section":"Headquarters","title":"Survey Workflow","type":"headquarters","url":"/headquarters/interviews/survey-workflow/","wordcount":505},{"content":" The headquarters software is a suite of connected tools for the administrator and headquarters users: to track the overall progress of the survey (Reports) to review completed interviews (Interviews) to manage the human resources (Teams and Roles) to specify survey instruments, create survey assignments with those instruments(Survey Setup) to export the data collected from these assignments (Data Export) to find a check the status of particular case assignments (Troubleshooting) The difference between the headquarters and administrator users is that the administrator can create headquarters/observer user accounts, archive user accounts, and delete questionnaire templates from the headquarters server.

To help speed up your work, Survey Solutions allows you to batch upload many assignments at once using a tab delimited. Follow the steps below to perform a batch upload of assignments: Step 1 Create a tab-delimited file with the identifying information for your assignments Before performing an interview, data collection teams must know the name (e.g., name and surname of the head of household) and/or location (e.g., region, county, district, neighborhood) of who they should be interviewing. To facilitate locating the respondents, this identifying information will appear on the dashboard of enumerator app for each interview for which they are responsible. When designing the questionnaire template, each of the identifying variables that you want to appear on the dashboard should be designated as Identifying. To do this, select Identifying as the scope of the question. After creating the questionnaire, you must define the sample for fieldwork. Create a tab-delimited (.tab) file where every column corresponds to a variable ​​designated as Identifying and every row—to an assignment. You can leave some ***Identifying ***information blank for any assignment. Any identifying information left blank can be filled out by the interviewers. Step 2 Specify the person responsible for the assignment and the quantity of interviews per assignment Add a column titled _responsible and populate the fields with the appropriate supervisor or interview usernames to avoid having to create and upload a tab-delimited file for each interviewer or supervisor. Add a column titled _quantity and populate the fields with the maximum number of interviews you want per assignment. To specify an unlimited quantity, put \u0026lsquo;-1\u0026rsquo; in the column. If you do leave the field blank or if there is no _quantity column in your tab delimited file, then the quantity of interview will automatically be set to \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; per assignment. Step 3 Upload the sample to your server The first step is to click on the Survey Setup tab and select Questionnaires. Then, click on the questionnaire template for which you would like to upload the sample. Once the list of options is displayed select Upload assignments. Afterwards, click the Upload .tab File button to select the .tab file that defines the sample.

Click on the name of the section to quickly move there. 5. Validation After you have answered the question, the frame around it can turn red. If the color does not change, then the answer to the question probably doesn’t contain any errors. If it is red, the answer is not the expected one. An accompanying error message may give you more information about what went wrong. 6. Your progress Survey Solutions uses a simple scheme for communicating to interviewers the status of each section. Green indicates that a section is complete—that is, that all questions have been answered and none have invalid answers. Blue denotes incomplete—that is, that some question are unanswered. Red indicates that one or more questions in the answer have an invalid answer—that is, an answer that violates the validation condition. 7. Adding comments Tap and hold your finger on the text of the question to enable the comment field. Comments can be used to provide further explanation to respondent’s answers that can be shared with your supervisor. 8. Completing the interview To complete the interview, click on the button on the top left of the screen and click on the Complete button at the bottom of the menu. You will see a summary screen. The number next to the Unanswered button indicates how many questions have been left unanswered. Similarly, the Errors button provides the number of questions with invalid answers. You can write in the Note for supervisor field any comments or observations that you would like to share with your supervisor. When you are sure that the interview is completed, press Complete to finish it and return to the Dashboard, where you will be able to select another household and start a new interview.

Rosters are defined by a set of properties. While some features are common to all roster types, others are defined for a specific roster source. Survey Solutions has 4 roster sources. Three of them depend on the question type linked to the roster: numeric question, list question and multi-select question. No question is linked to the fourth roster source: fixed set of items. Non-nested rosters can have up to 200 rows. If there are over 60 rows in the roster, the roster can contain up to 500 questions, on the other hand if there are more than 60 rows in the roster then the roster cannot contain more than 30 questions. This is particularly useful for market price and food consumption rosters, which typically have more than 100 rows on paper, they can now be designed as a single, large roster in Survey Solutions. Creating a roster To define the roster type: Click on the Roster source dropdown box. From the pop-up menu select the roster type by clicking on it. The answer to the source question or the number of fixed set of items, defines the number of times the questions within the roster are repeated. This means that there will be a set of questions for each subject (individual, enterprise, crop, land, food item, non-food item, etc.). For this reason, a subject id (name, code id, etc.) is needed to differentiate the set of questions among the different subjects. The subject’s id can either be created automatically during the interview or be fixed. When creating a roster make sure that you have defined the maximum number of answers allowed in the roster source (trigger) question, or in other words the maximum number of roster rows that can be created. Roster types Numeric roster The roster source is a numeric question. For example, consider the following questions: How many people live in the household? How many partners does the enterprise have? How many lands do you cultivate? How many crops did you harvest in the land? The total number of household members, partners, lands or crops determines how many times the questions within the roster will be repeated. The pictures below show an example of a numeric roster. In Questionnaire Designer: On a tablet: List roster The roster source is a list question. For example, consider the following questions: *List the people living in the household. List the employees working in the enterprise. List the lands you cultivate. List the crops you harvested in the land. * The total number of listed household members, employees, lands or crops determines how many times the questions within the roster will be repeated. The pictures below show an example of a list roster. In Questionnaire Designer: On a tablet: Multi-select roster The roster source question is a multi-select question. A multi-select question in yes/no mode may also be used as a roster source question. Below are a few examples of multi-select questions: Was [the food items below] purchased in the last week? (in yes/no mode) From the listed crops select those cultivated in your land From the listed types of payment, select those accepted by the enterprise The total number of selected food items, crops, or types of payment determines how many times the questions within the roster will be repeated. In the case of a multi-select question in yes/no mode the number of items marked as \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; in the multi-select question will determine how many times the questions within the roster will be repeated. The pictures below show an example of multi-select roster. In Questionnaire Designer: On a tablet: The pictures below show an example of multi-select roster in yes/no mode.

The list of possible answers can either be defined before the interview or it can be created during the interview. If you are defining the categories prior to the interview you can add the categories in the design phase one at a time or by copying and pasting them from a document. On the other hand, if you want to create the categories during the interview you would need to link the question to a previous question or roster, so that the categories of the former are the answers given to the latter. This question type provides the option of preserving the order in which the options are selected and/or defining the maximum number of options that can be selected. For example, if you are conducting a survey to improve the marketing of your product you are probably interested in knowing which two colors are most preferred by your potential customer. In this situation, you can ask “Select two colors you like” and have the interviewee select only two colors from those listed. Next, consider a survey where the order to which respondents rank their answers is important. For example, you would like to conduct a survey in your organization in order to better understand human relationships among your employees. You are interested to know the three most important human values in the order of importance to which each employee ranks them. Therefore, you would include in your survey the question “In order of importance select the three most important values a person should have” and define the question’s properties to be ordered with the maximum number of selected answers to equal three. You can also link a categorical: multi-select **** question to a previous roster or question (text, numeric, or date) in a roster. Imagine a survey that collects information about the type of aid a population group has received. For this study you are interested to know which individual in the household has received some type of aid, in order to see if there is a connection to certain information, such as age and/or gender. As you foresee that more than one household member may have received aid, you can create the question “Which of the household members received any type of aid last month?” This question will be a categorical multiple-answer question linked to a household list roster. Creating a categorical: multi-select question In Questionnaire Designer Click on the Question Type box. Select Categorical: Multi-select from the list displayed. You can add the categories one at time or by copying and pasting them from a document. Add categories one at a time To add the categories one at a time, first click on the button Add option to assign the necessary number of categories for the possible answers. Add a code that uniquely identifies each possible answer. The codes must be positive integers. Add the label corresponding to the code. Each label defines a possible answer. Copy paste categories Click on Show Strings link. Paste the category titles and their corresponding codes in the box. The category title and code must be separated by one or more dots (“.\u0026quot;). How a categorical: multi-select question appears on a tablet The enumerator selects one or more answer options by selecting each checkbox. Options Yes/no mode Categorical: multi-select questions can be displayed with yes/no radio buttons for each item. Consider the following question as an example: “Does the enterprise sell [ITEM]?” To display the yes/no radio buttons for each item, click on the YES/NO mode checkbox. On a tablet, an enumerator selects one of two radio buttons denoting “Yes” and “No” for each category listed. Record answer order Categorical: multi-select questions have the option to order answers according to a criterion, such as an order of importance or preference. To have the answers sorted by a criterion, click on the Record answer order box. Consider the following question as an example: “Select, in order of importance, the three most important values a person should have”. When the enumerator begins selecting options, sequential numbers (starting from one) will be displayed to the right of each selected category. In this example, the enumerator selected Honesty first, followed by Other, and then Gratitude lastly. Maximum number of answers A categorical: multi-select question provides the option of assigning a maximum number of valid answers. In order to limit the number of selected categories in an answer you can add the maximum valid number in the Max number of answers field. The enumerator may select the same or less than the number of categories as the defined maximum number of answers (in this example the maximum number is 3). Once the maximum number of categories have been selected the remaining will be disabled. Linked When the question is linked to a question (text, numeric, or date) or roster the categories are created during the interview. The categories created are the answers the interviewee has given in the previous question or roster source question. For example, if a question asks for the household members who visited a doctor during the past month, you need to link this question to a previous one within the roster, which asks the names of all the household members. To link a question to another question, click on the Is linkedbox. Click on the Bind to question from roster group dropdown menu for a list of questions and rosters that can be linked. Select the appropriate question or roster. Filtered answer options You can define a filter to describe the conditions under which answer options will be displayed to the interviewer via the Filter field for multi-select categorical questions. Linked questions can also include a filter. In food consumption modules, questionnaire designers can limit answer options to those that make sense for each food item (e.g., weight units for solids, volume units for liquids).

The Filter field contains a condition that is evaluated against each potential answer option. When the condition is true for a particular answer option, that answer option is displayed. When the condition is false (or yields an exception), that option is not displayed in Interviewer. In other words, the feature functions like an enabling condition for answer options, enabling only those answer options that satisfy the filter condition. There are also two new keywords that are only available in the Filter field. For non-linked questions, the keyword @optioncode provides a way to refer to the answer options for the current question. For linked questions, the keyword @current used as a variable prefix, allows you to differentiate between the value of a variable for current roster row and that for all other rows in the current roster. For example, one may filter down the list of potential fathers to those members that are older than the current person (the child) by writing: age \u0026gt; @current.age To add a condition on the answer options of a categorical question, define the filter in the Filter box. Export Categorical questions are comprised of codes (hidden from enumerators) and labels (visible to enumerators). Categorical multi-select questions are exported into multiple columns in the output file. Each column name is comprised of the original variable name specified in the Designer and a suffix corresponding to a particular option code, for example, a multi-select question on the presence of various assets in the household may be exported as variables: assets__101, assets__102, assets__103, where \u0026lsquo;assets\u0026rsquo; is the name of the question specified in Designer, and \u0026lsquo;101\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;102\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;103\u0026rsquo; are the codes of items in this question. When a question has no limit on the number of answers that can be selected (the enumerator can select all the categories), the system creates the same number of variables as the categories. However, if the question has defined a maximum number of valid answers (lower than the total number of categories), the system creates the same number of variables as the number defined in the Max number of answers field. Linked To understand how data from a linked categorical: multi-select question is exported, we have to also consider the type of roster where (triggered by a question or with fixed titles) the “link to” question is housed. The reason for this is that the system creates the same number of variables as the potential maximum number of records that the roster can display. This means that the number defined in the Max number of answers field is taken into account when recording the question’s answer, but not when exporting the data. The examples below illustrate the variations of the categorical multiple-answer question. The first example refers to the question: “Select all the assets the household has” where codes from 1 to 6 represent: television, fridge, washing machine, dishwasher, dryer and freezer respectively. The enumerator can select from one to all of the categories listed without preserving the order in which the categories were selected. This example illustrates an example where the enumerator does not select all the options. Categorical multi-select question that is not linked Unanswered question exported in tab-delimited file Answered question exported in tab-delimited file Multi-select question in yes/no mode The second example refers to the question: “Does the enterprise sell [ITEM]?” where codes from 1 to 5 represent: cereals, roots and tubers, vegetables, fruits, and meat and fish respectively. The enumerator selects “yes” or “no” for each of the categories listed. Unanswered question exported in tab-delimited file Answered question exported in tab-delimited file The next example illustrates a categorical: multi-select question that expects a maximum of three categories to be selected and ordered by a criterion. In this example, the question is: “Select, in order of importance, the three most important values a person should have” where codes from 1 to 6 represents: honesty, sincerity, loyalty, gratitude, respect and other respectively. Unanswered question exported in tab-delimited file Answered question exported in tab-delimited file Because of this question’s defined properties (the enumerator can select a maximum of three categories. In this example, the maximum number of permitted categories were selected. The enumerator selected Honesty first, then Other and finally Gratitude. As the question is ordered in this example, the system saved their respective codes in the variables following the order in which they were selected. The next example illustrates the data export of a linked categorical: multi-select question for which all the categories can be selected and the order in which the categories are selected is not preserved. In this example, the question: “Which of the household members received any type of aid last month?” is linked to the question: “Name of the household member”. So, let’s imagine that the answer to the latter was: Ann, Paul, Mary and Michael. The system automatically creates the codes: 0,1,2 and 3 for each name respectively. If Ann, Mary and Michael have received aid, the system exports the values 0, 2 and 3. Previous question located within a roster Unanswered question exported in tab-delimited file Answered question exported in tab-delimited file The last example shows the data exported from a linked categorical: multi-select question that expected a maximum of two selected categories and the order in which the categories were selected to have been preserved. In this example, the question: “From the harvest of last year, select the two crops that had the highest yield starting with the lowest.” is linked to the question: “Name crops that you harvested last year\u0026quot;. Let’s imagine that the answer to the latter was: Maize, Wheat, Cassava and Rice. The system automatically creates the codes: 0,1,2 and 3 for each crop respectively.

This list can either be defined before the interview or it can be created during the interview. To define the categories beforehand, you can add them one at a time, copy and paste them from a document, or upload them from a tab-delimited file in Questionnaire Designer. To create the categories during the interview, the categorical: single-select question must belinked to a previous question (text, numeric, date) in a roster or to a roster. For example, some surveys ask about the respondent and expect the enumerator to type the respondent’s name. However, instead of typing the respondent’s name the enumerator can select it from a list containing the names of the household members. To do this, the question “Which of the household members is the respondent?” needs to be linked to a previous question, such as “Name each household member”. If the categorical: single-select question is not linked, you have the option of defining it as a cascade question. This means that during the interview the list of categories can be filtered by the answer given to a previous categorical: single-select (parent question). It is common in surveys to find questions with a very long list of possible answers that can be shortened by setting a certain criteria to filter the categories. For example, in a national survey knowing the province of the household can shorten the list of regions. Therefore, the question “Region in which the household is located” can be defined as a cascade question having the categorical: single-select question “Province in which the household is located” as its parent question.

Select Upload and confirm your selection with the Apply button. Update the options click on the reload link. After importing the categories you can edit them by clicking on the Upload new options link. On a tablet the enumerator has to: Tap on the question box. Start typing letters, so that a subset of categories that have been filtered by the typed letters is shown. Select the appropriate answer. Cascade combo box The cascade option is useful when the list of categories is large and it can be filtered by the answer given to a previous categorical one-answer question. For example, a national survey asks for the province, the region and the district. Therefore, the province can filter the categories for region, and region can filter the categories for district. To accomplish this task you need to define the question responsible for filtering (parent question) and upload the categories from a tab-delimited file. Create a tab-delimited file without headings and with the categories’ codes and description in the first and second column respectively. The third column should contain the categories’ codes of the parent question. Click on the cascading combo box and then define the question that will filter the categories (parent question). To define the parent question, click on the Select parent question dropdown box and select the question from those listed. Add the categories by clicking on the Add options link. In the pop-up window displayed click on Choose file and select the tab-delimited file you have prepared. Click on the Upload button and confirm your selection by clicking on the Apply button. Update the categories click on the reload link. After importing the categories, you can edit them by clicking on theUpload new options\u0026lt; link. On a tablet the enumerator has to: Tap on the question text box. Starts typing letters, so that a subset of options first filtered by the parent question and then by the entered letters, is shown. Select the appropriate option. Linked question Categories can be created during the interview when the categorical: single-select question is linked to another question or roster. The categories created are the answers given to a previous question, or a roster source question. The single-select question can be linked to a question in a roster (text, numeric, or date), or to a roster. For example, you can create categories when a question located in a roster records the name of all the household members, or when a roster source question asks for the list of all household members.

To link a question to a previous question, Click on the Is linked box. Click on the Bind to question from roster group dropdown menu, and select the appropriate question or roster. On a tablet the linked question displays the list of categories an enumerator can choose from. Filtered answer options You can define a filter to describe the conditions under which answer options will be displayed to the interviewer via the Filter field for single select categorical questions. Linked questions can also include a filter. In food consumption modules, questionnaire designers can limit answer options to those that make sense for each food item (e.g., weight units for solids, volume units for liquids). In demographic modules, you can filter a linked question that lists potential owners of the household’s dwelling to the set of age relevant household members. The Filter field contains a condition that is evaluated against each potential answer option. When the condition is true for a particular answer option, that answer option is displayed. When the condition is false (or yields an exception), that option is not displayed in Interviewer. In other words, the feature functions like an enabling condition for answer options, enabling only those answer options that satisfy the filter condition. There are also two new keywords that are only available in the Filter field. For non-linked questions, the keyword @optioncode provides a way to refer to the answer options for the current question. For linked questions, the keyword @current, used as a variable prefix, allows you to differentiate between the value of a variable for current roster row and that for all other rows in the current roster. For example, one may filter down the list of potential fathers to those members that are older than the current person (the child) by writing: age @current.age. To add a condition on the answer options of a categorical question, define the filter in the Filter box. Export Categorical questions are composed of codes (hidden from enumerators) and labels (visible to enumerators). When data from a categorical question is exported the code of the selected answer is saved as a numeric variable in a tab-delimited file. The name of this variable is the question’s variable name defined in the Questionnaire Designer. Category codes created prior to conducting the interview are those that have been defined in the Questionnaire Designer. Categories that are created during the interview are automatically given codes in a sequential order, where 0 corresponds to the first category.

Each answer can contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z,0-9) and basic punctuation symbols. By default the enumerator can add up to 40 items; however you can limit the number of items that can be listed by defining the maximum number of answers. For example, very frequently national household surveys ask the enumerator to list all the household members, instead of first asking for the total number of people living in the household and then for their names. Therefore, because the household size is unknown it can be any number. You would define the question in the following manner: “List the names of the people who live in the household” without limiting the household size. On the other hand, there are some questions where you would like the answer list to be limited to a certain number. For example, in a survey measuring household food security vulnerability, one of the questions asked may be “List up to four threats that make your household at risk of being food insecure”.

The default question scope is interviewer. Identifying The role of the questions defined as identifying includes the definition of uniqueness for the interviews and supplies ‘driving directions’ for the enumerators. Different types of information can be provided through these questions. Some examples are: province, household id, household address, national identification number and name of the household head. Identifying questions can only be text, numeric, date and categorical: single-select questions. The behavior of questions defined as identifying and who is responsible for answering them depends on whether or not headquarters provides the information when creating the assignment. If not filled in during assignment creation, enumerators answer the identifying questions within questionnaires and the answers can be modified before completing the interview. The picture below shows how an enumerator will answer identifying questions on a tablet. When answers are provided by headquarters during assignment creation, the answers cannot be modified once the interview is created. The picture below shows how a headquarters user will answer identifying questions when creating an assignment. On the tablet, the enumerator sees the answers to the identifying questions on the dashboard screen within the Interviewer application. Hidden When the scope HIDDEN is selected, the question is destined to be hidden and store the prefilled values to be used in validations and enabling conditions. For example, one may create a validation that the highest educational attainment of a person now is no lower than it was during the last visit.

Each component is defined by a set of properties. Some features are common to all questionnaire components, and others are defined for specific components. In this article you will learn how to define variable names, variable labels, question texts, question types, interviewer instructions, and conditions. Variable name The variable name is the unique identifier of a component, which is useful when exporting the data for analysis. It has to start with a letter, but can also contain numbers and the underscore symbol. As it is not needed during the interview, the variable name is not visible on the tablet. Variable label The variable label is the description of the data captured by the question and it will be associated to the variable name when exporting the data to a statistical software package. If the variable label is not entered, the system automatically exports the question text as its label. As it is not needed during the interview, the variable label is not visible on the tablet. Question text The Question text box contains the text that the enumerator will read to the interviewee. Therefore, it is suggested to use regular language when defining the text. For instance, “How many people live in your household?” instead of “People living in the HH“. The text of the question can be interactive; this means that it can change according to answers given in previous questions. There are two ways to apply this feature. First method Use an answer given in any previous question in another question’s text. To do this, include in the question’s text the variable name of a previous question within percentage symbols. Second method Use an answer given to a previous question that triggers a roster in the question text. To do this, include “rostertitle” or the roster variable name within percentage symbols in the question text. Question Types The expected answer type determines the question type to use. The available question types are as follows: Type of question Icon Data captured Text Alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), basic punctuation symbols and space. Numeric Numeric characters (0-9). Integer or Real numbers. Date A date in the Gregorian calendar. The format of the date corresponds with the tablet’s date settings. Categorical: Single-select One option from a list of answer options which are mutually exclusive. Categorical: Multi-select One or more options from a list of answer options. List An open list composed of alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), basic punctuation symbols and space. GPS Set of geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, accuracy, altitude), which identify the location of the tablet. Barcode Optical machine-readable representation of data relating to an object. Picture Binary files. Static-text Does not capture data. To define the question type: Click on the *question type *dropdown box. From the pop-up menu select the question type by clicking on it. Interviewer Instructions For each question, you can add instructions to be read by the enumerator while performing the interview. To add interviewer instructions, Click on the Add Interviewer instructions link. Add the text in the field. ​ On the tablet the instructions will be shown in blue below the question text. The instructions specified can also be hidden until the interviewer clicks on Instruction link to reveal the text. To do this, check the Hide instruction check box. Conditions In this section you will learn about enabling and validation conditions. Enabling conditions allow you to enable or disable certain questions based on answers an interviewee has given in previous questions, while validation conditions evaluate whether an answer given by an interviewee is acceptable. Enabling Conditions Enabling conditions are the Survey Solutions equivalents of skip patterns in paper-based questionnaires. By using conditions you can enable or disable certain questions based on the answers an interviewee has given in previous questions. For this reason, at least two questions are involved, let’s call them: the unleash question and the recipient question. For example, if the template has the questions “Do you speak any foreign language?” and “Which foreign language do you speak?” it does not make sense to ask the second question if the interviewee does not speak a foreign language. Therefore, in this example the first question is the unleash one and the second is the recipient one. If the answer to the unleash question is “Yes”, the recipient question is enabled. On the contrary if the answer is “No“, the recipient question remains disabled. Conditions are written in C# programming language, which is very easy to learn. You simply have to connect a variable name with values or another variable name using logical operators. For this example, the unleash question is a categorical: Single-select question with variable name foreign and possible answers: 1-“Yes” and 2-“No“ Write the logical expression in the Enabling condition text field of the recipient question. The text box also autosuggests roster names and variable names as you type syntax conditions and helps avoid confusion with numerous standard C# keywords. In the example the condition expression to enable the recipient question is: foreign== 1 For more information on how to write logical expressions, please see our complete syntax guide. The question will appear greyed out if it is disabled. To hide the recipient question if it is disabled, select theHide if disabled check box. The pictures below show how this example is displayed on the tablet. To indicate that a question includes an enablement condition an orange dot will display next to the variable name on the section navigation pane. Validation Conditions Validation conditions are created similarly to enabling conditions. Instead of evaluating whether the question has to be displayed, it determines whether the answer given by the interviewee is acceptable. These can also be programmed as validation warnings. The warnings are rendered differently from errors (appear in orange color rather than red) and not counted in the interview errors counter. They are also not recorded in paradata.

Example 1: We want to define a variable fullName that is a combination of a person\u0026rsquo;s first name (question firstName) and a person\u0026rsquo;s last name (question lastName). Here the variable would be a String type because the variable will be text. Example 2: We want to define a variable countMissingAssets to count the number of household assets where yes or no has not yet been filled in for categorical multi-select question (question hhAssets) that is in yes/no mode.Here the variable type would be Long Integer because we expect the number of items missing a response to be a whole number. We can later to use it in a static text to the interviewer that will tell them how many assets they still have not filled out yes or not to. Example 3: We want to define a variable hhsize that will compute the household size. We intend to use this later in validation conditions in the household food consumption module to calculate the amount of food item that was consumed per capita. Here the variable type would be Long Integer because we expect the household size to be whole number. hhroster is the name of the roster that the household members are listed in and name is the variable that contains the household member\u0026rsquo;s names. To get the household size, we are counting the number of non-empty names that are listed on the roster","keywords":["variables","boolean","double","string","date/time","long integer"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"June 16, 2016","objectID":"ee9e73b09798e54a2792e40a4a8d3b92","section":"Questionnaire Designer","title":"Variables","type":"questionnaire-designer","url":"/questionnaire-designer/components/variables/","wordcount":536},{"content":" **This article will show you how to create, select, copy, move, and delete questionnaire components. ** Create All questionnaire components with the exception of sections can be created in the same manner.

Every section can in turn contain one or more: Sub-sections, Question, Roster, Static Text, and Variables. Sub-sections Subsections can contain one or more static-texts, questions, other sub-sections and rosters. They are used to group a set of questions related to a specific topic. For instance in household surveys a subsection can be used to group the questions related to the household’s characteristics. The main difference between subsections and rosters is that the questions within a sub-section are only asked once in an interview. Questions You can add a question at the section level (not included in any sub-section or roster), within sub-sections or rosters, or after any question in the questionnaire. The available question types are displayed in the table below. Type of question Icon Data captured Text Alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), basic punctuation symbols and space. Numeric Numeric characters (0-9). Integer or Real numbers. Date A date in the Gregorian calendar. The format of the date corresponds with the tablet’s date settings . Categorical: Single-select One option from a list of answer options which are mutually exclusive. Categorical: Multi-select One or more options from a list of answer options. List An open list composed of alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), basic punctuation symbols and space. GPS Set of geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, accuracy, altitude), which identify the location of the tablet. Barcode Optical machine-readable representation of data relating to an object. Picture Binary files. Static-text Does not capture data. Rosters Sometimes it is necessary to repeat the same set of questions multiple times. Rosters allow you to create an auto-propagated group of questions. In other words, roster groups are used to display the same set of questions several times. For example, a roster group can be implemented in national household or agricultural surveys. In the former the enumerator collects data on name, age, gender, etc. per household member. In the latter the enumerator collects data on crop, quantity harvested, unit of the quantity, etc. per plot of land. As all the questions within the group will be asked for each individual or item, it is necessary to have an individual or item id (titles of the rows) that identifies each set of questions. These titles can be created automatically (during the interview) or manually (during the creation of the questionnaire). The latter are also called fixed set of items. Survey Solutions has 4 roster sources. Three of them depend on the question type linked to the roster : numeric question, list question and multi-select question. No question is linked to the fourth roster source: fixed set of items. Static-text Static-texts are used to convey information to the enumerator or the interviewee. An example of the former can be: “When listing the employees, begin with the director and then continue with the names of the other employees in order of responsibility, from highest to lowest.” An example for the latter can be: “All information collected in this questionnaire is confidential and will be used for statistical purposes only. Variables Variables are computable expressions, which can be added to a questionnaire for convenience when operating with large and/or complex expressions. Variables are a powerful addition to the functionality of Survey Solutions. Variables can be used to simplify and improve the validation and enabling conditions. Content of variables can be used in the question text or in static text to provide more informative, dynamic questions or static text.","keywords":["sections","sub-section","roster","question types","variables","static-text","building questionnaire"],"lang":"en","lastmod":"June 16, 2016","objectID":"a847e83e8294c08218a1feda294e8308","section":"Questionnaire Designer","title":"Questionnaire Components ","type":"questionnaire-designer","url":"/questionnaire-designer/components/questionnaire-components-/","wordcount":585},{"content":" Lookup tables are reference tables that may be used in validation and enabling conditions. They are prepared as external tab-delimited files and uploaded to the questionnaire in the Designer. We use lookup tables to find content by some code and apply it in validations and enabling conditions as part of larger expressions. Often times this lookup code is a code of an item in a price survey, occupational code in a labor force survey, or a code of crop in an agricultural survey. Lookup tables are particularly convenient for storing time series data, such as historical exchange rates for various currencies. Other uses involve storing estimated crop yields by crop, ranges of salaries by occupation, etc. While anthropometric z-scores can be implemented via lookup tables as well, users should refer to specialized z-score functions instead. The lookup tables must conform to the following format: Contain the “rowcode” column, and up to 10 other numeric columns with reference data. Values in “rowcode” column must be integer and unique Other columns may contain repetitive content, as well as fractions. Lookup tables may include up to 5,000 rows of reference data. Multiple lookup tables may be defined within the same questionnaire. How to upload a look up table Click on the lookup table iconon the left hand panel. Click on the Add new lookup tablelink. Type in the *table name, *and click on the *select file *link to upload the table delimited lookup table. Click save. The short syntax for the reference in condition expressions is: LookupTableName[code].ColumnName It requires the name of the lookup table, the value of the code, and the name of the column for the content of interest Consider the following example: Suppose, that you want to add a validation condition that provides an error message for plot areas that are greater than 2 hectares. However, the single-select unit question allows for the plot area to be reported in other units of measurement in addition to hectare. The tab delimited lookup table with unit conversion factors. After uploading the tab-delimited lookup table following the directions explained previously, We will add the following validation expression to the single-select unit question. Here, plotarea refers to numeric area question. ConversionFactors is the name of the look up table we have uploaded to Designer. Self refers to the single-select unit question that holds the validation expression, and conversion refers to the conversion factor column in the lookup table. If “Acre” is selected, then the reported plot area will be multiplied by row 1 of the “conversion” column in the lookup table. And, this calculated value must be less than 2 hectare. The same follows for the other possible units. To see a demonstration of this process check out this video.

It is a step into modern technology that may be more expensive for the first one or two surveys, but subsequent surveys will be far less expensive, will provide much higher data quality, and the data will be available for analysis much faster than when using PAPI. The staff members who implement a CAPI survey will gain experience in a technology that is rapidly becoming the standard throughout the world of data collection, so your entire organization will be more competitive. The decision to use CAPI should go hand-in-hand with the choice of data entry and management software that is used. Many factors should be considered when making these decisions: Should CAPI be considered at all? For example, will a paper trail be required, or will a statistical database be sufficient? Do local laws and regulations permit the electronic storage and transmission of survey data? Will the fieldwork require constant or frequent monitoring? For some software this would suggest the need for widely available cell phone or Internet service. Will the interviews be conducted in multiple languages?1 Does the questionnaire include more than one respondent? Are you willing and able to pay the initial costs of tablets and training for the long-term benefits of CAPI? Will the listing be conducted prior to or during the interviewing process? The answers to these questions will help to guide the decision whether to use CAPI, and if so, which software to use. Every CAPI software package has strengths and weaknesses, and they should be taken into account during this decision-making process. For a comparison of the different CAPI packages (except Survey Solutions) see this World Bank-funded [report from 2011] (http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSURAGRI/Resources/7420178-1294259038276/CAPI.Software.Assessment.Main.Report.pdf). Direct Costs One component of CAPI costs is for the tablets on which the data are collected. The most popular of these devices, and at present the least expensive, run on the Android operating system. Each interviewer must have her or his own tablet computer for data collection, so this can represent a substantial initial investment. Fortunately these devices can be reused on future surveys, so after this initial investment the only costs will be for replacements of lost or damaged units. As of the spring of 2015, an Android tablet powerful enough to run Survey Solutions cost at about US$150-$250 in the USA. A list of tablet computers that have been tested for use with Survey Solutions can be found here. Cost should not be the only consideration when selecting the appropriate tablet for data collection. The operating system should be the first consideration, since most data entry packages run on either Windows or Android tablets, although some run on both. These considerations include battery life, charging time, screen size and resolution, connectivity options (such as cell phone, Bluetooth, USB, wifi, and connectivity between tablets), and durability under harsh environmental conditions (such as hot and code temperatures, rain, and sand storms). Note that prices of both Windows and Android tablets have been dropping dramatically over the past several years and there is every reason to believe they will continue to do so. Another cost of CAPI surveys is for training of interviewers. Interviewer training is also required for PAPI surveys, but CAPI interviewers must also be trained on the use of the tablets. Field supervisors and headquarters staff will also need to be trained on the use of these devices, as well as the differences in the way CAPI surveys are managed. These differences typically result in a more streamlined process which provides field teams with faster, more targeted feedback than with PAPI surveys, and that provides higher data quality. Another cost relates to communications and connectivity. Depending on availability, the data and quality control information must be exchanged between the field teams and headquarters using either cell phone or Internet connectivity. Whichever is used, additional user accounts will likely be required. Most CAPI systems now rely on case and data management systems that reside on local, remote, or cloud-based servers. If the server is local this will include the cost of the server hardware and software as well as server maintenance. If the server is hosted remotely or in the cloud, monthly costs may amount to US$150 per server. Each server may host multiple surveys. Survey Solutions offers many options for configuring servers. These options are described here. Indirect Costs Technical support is the major cost to consider when deciding whether to switch to CAPI. Depending on the CAPI system these costs can total several hundred thousand US dollars and might completely overshadow the direct costs of CAPI equipment and training. Survey Solutions is designed to minimize indirect costs. Still, there is likely to be the need for some technical assistance for the first one or two surveys. The extent of this TA will depend on the specific requirements in each country and will be determined after discussions with the Survey Solutions team. Benefits There are many benefits to using CAPI to replace PAPI data collection. First and foremost is the improvement of data quality. When data are rapidly available for assessment after they are collected, errors in fieldwork can be corrected and changes in procedures, if needed, can be implemented quickly. Another benefit is the elimination of paper questionnaires, reducing printing costs and reducing the burden on field teams to ensure they have sufficient numbers of blank forms. Transmission of the results of the interviews is done electronically so a package delivery network is no longer needed. The day that fieldwork is completed the data are immediately available for review and cleaning without the need to finish entering data from the remaining paper forms. This means that analysis can begin sooner and results will be available earlier. An advantage of Survey Solutions is that it does not require extensive programming; it can be implemented by survey research organizations with no or","keywords":[""],"lang":"en","lastmod":"September 13, 2018","objectID":"6a4d4f92cb3e606c202dda1c84a4461d","section":"Getting Started","title":"Implementing a CAPI survey with Survey Solutions","type":"getting-started","url":"/getting-started/implementing-a-capi-survey/","wordcount":2232},{"content":" minimal need for outside consultants. CAPI Scheduling A typical CAPI survey requires at least 3 months for fieldwork preparation. This is somewhat longer than for PAPI surveys, due to the need for tablet procurement for initial surveys, and the need for additional staff training. However, this schedule should be reduced after the first or second CAPI survey since most of the tablets will still be available and most of the staff will already be trained. Also, the data will be available for analysis earlier than they would be for a PAPI survey. An example of a typical CAPI survey is shown in Figure 1. While the schedule of a specific survey may be somewhat different from this example, it will not vary substantially based on the size of the sample. The length of fieldwork may vary considerably based on the ratio of size of the fieldwork team to the size of the sample, and whether listing efforts will take place before or during fieldwork. The example in Figure 1 does not include listing and assumes it is undertaken as a separate task. Obtain coverage maps for Internet access and from cellular providers: If you are planning to transmit data and monitor fieldwork directly from the data entry tablets, than widely available cellular and/or Internet coverage is essential. On the other hand, if frequent data transmission is not critical, or if fieldwork monitoring is available in the field, the need for widespread connectivity can be somewhat relaxed. Survey Solutions provides the option for field supervisors to manage and monitor data collection with infrequent cell phone or Internet connections. Select sample PSUs and compare with coverage maps: Once the sample PSUs are selected, coverage maps will help determine the best provider and routing of interviewer teams to optimize their opportunities to transfer data. If necessary use a combination of providers to increase coverage of selected PSUs or develop field work routines to cope with uncovered locations. Decision to use CAPI: This should be done in consultation with all stakeholders and with a clear understanding of this new technology. A major part of this decision includes the data network to use, whether it uses the Internet or cell phone infrastructure, or a combination of both. A comparison should be made between the selected primary sampling units (PSUs) and the availability of cell phone and/or Internet connectivity along with the anticipated frequency of remote fieldwork monitoring. Android tablet procurement: Procurement of the tablets should be started at an early stage. Check whether they are available in the country, and re- confirm their compatibility with the selected data entry software. Questionnaire implementation on tablets: Ideally training on the process of loading your questionnaire onto the interviewers' tablets should only be required the first time the software is used. Some data entry software requires the use of programming languages, and provides extensive flexibility and power for large, complex questionnaires. These packages generally require substantial training of technical staff or the extensive reliance on consulting assistance. Other software packages require little or no programming but are appropriate only for use with simple questionnaires and sample designs. Therefore the selection of survey processing software should take into account the types of surveys that are expected in the future. Learning to use the Survey Solutions questionnaire designer will enable your staff to create a data entry system for your current and future surveys regardless of their complexity. The trainees are not required to have programming skills, and after a brief training period should be able to create data entry systems for complex surveys with little or no additional outside assistance. In-house questionnaire testing. An initial test of the tablet data entry system should be conducted within your office, ideally by staff members who are familiar with the questionnaire and subject matter. This will help to resolve the most obvious errors prior to the field pre-test. Survey Solutions provides an easy- to-use questionnaire tester that enables any staff member with a user name, password, and tablet to test your questionnaire. Supervisor and Interviewer training: Supervisors should participate in the same training as interviewers to provide them with a clear understanding of the questionnaire and the use of the tablets. Field pre-test: This is the first opportunity to test the tablet-based data entry system under realistic conditions. Locations should be identified that are not included in the survey sample, and interviewers and supervisors should conduct realistic interviews with real households. This provides both a training experience for the field staff and a test of the data entry system. Modifications to questionnaire based on pre-test: Based on observations from the pre-test, problems with field procedures and the tablet questionnaire must be resolved. If necessary, changes should be made to the data entry system on the tablets. The result of this task is the final version of the data entry system. Pilot test: After the questionnaire is finalized in the previous task, the pilot will test the final questionnaire as it is implemented on the tablets, and will also focus on connectivity and communications. This will test your network infrastructure and ensure that interviewers and supervisors are familiar with data transfer procedures. This will ensure that all of the changes based on the first pre-test have been properly implemented and that the data can be transferred when needed. It will also ensure that all supervisors are able to provide the necessary support to their teams in the event of a technical failure in the field. Supervisor training: This training should clearly define the role of the field supervisors, and enable them to use the data and case management tools they will be using in the field. This will enable the supervisors to take advantage of CAPI by checking the quality and completeness of the data as they are collected. In most data collection software, this is done by visually checking the data on the tablets or using separate management software.

This provides the survey team with more time to learn about and respond to problems in the field. Training on data export, import, and analysis: This training should only be required the first time Survey Solutions is used. Survey Solutions provides a straightforward method for exporting its data to tab-delimited files. These files are organized as a relational database, with the ability to easily import and merge them into files that can be used for statistical analysis. We provide the training to export, import, and analyse the Survey Solutions data. Data cleaning and analysis: This is the final step in the primary use of the survey data. With Survey Solutions, data cleaning should be minimal since the data entry and built-in case management systems check for most of the fieldwork problems encountered with other data entry systems. A manual for field supervisors using Survey Solutions can be found here. Survey Solutions has data and case management tools built in, as the Headquarters Guide. Training on this component will only be needed for the first survey using Survey Solutions. It will enable the supervisors to check questionnaires, communicate with the field teams and headquarters, and to generate and interpret reports.

The message is sent automatically if the bulk email sender has been configured. Complete This notification message is sent to the respondents who has completed an interview immediately when they complete it. The message may mention %SURVEYNAME%, which will be automatically replaced with the name of the survey. It may also mention in %-% signs any variable name from the main interview level (not inside of any roster) of a type supported in text substitutions, such as for example, %address% the value of which will be automatically substituted with a value entered by the respondent in the interview. For the categorical single select questions the default survey language is used for the text label corresponding to the selected answer regardless which language was used by the respondent at the time of the interview. The date and timestamp answers are written using an invariant date format. In the rare occasion when a question with variable name specifically SURVEYNAME is defined in an interview, the text substitution %SURVEYNAME% is resolved to the name of the survey, not the value of this variable. Optionally, the variable name may be suffixed with :barcode or :qrcode, such as for example: %product:barcode% or %checksum:qrcode%. Then the value of the corresponding variable will be rendered as a barcode or a qrcode respectively. For linear barcodes the code 128 standard is used. For 2-dimensional qrcodes the QR-code standard is used.
