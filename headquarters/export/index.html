A particular survey may come up with a numbering like 2 digits of the province code, followed by 3 digits of the district code, followed by the household id of 4 digits. Yet it is not a good identifier in the case where several surveys are conducted on the same server, or there may be repetitive visits, and other twists.</p><span class="data d-block">October 5, 2020</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/headquarters/export/metadata-organization/>Organization of meta-data storage in the exported data</a></h3><p>Survey Solutions export file is a zip-archive with multiple data files corresponding to various levels of data and system-generated accompanying data reflecting the comments, errors, statuses and other technical information about interviews and assignments. When the corresponding setting is activated in the export interface, the data is accompanied with the meta-data reflecting the structure of the questionnaire. The meta-data is saved to the subfolder Questionnaire of the export archive.
The questionnaire subfolder contains the following information:</p><span class="data d-block">September 17, 2020</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/headquarters/export/interview_diagnostics_file/>Interview diagnostics file</a></h3><p>interview__diagnostics file is a special service file, automatically produced with every data export, that contains useful information for assessing the quality of interviews:
number of invalid entities (invalid answers and errors in static texts), number of questions with comments, duration of the interview etc. For a description of available fields and their types, refer to this article.
This is especially useful for user-written monitoring systems that work alongside Survey Solutions and continually monitor the quality of incoming data by periodically exporting the data and building customized reports.</p><span class="data d-block">October 1, 2019</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/headquarters/export/system-generated-export-file-anatomy/>System generated files</a></h3><p>Every archive of data exported from the Survey Solutions Headquarters contains among the user data the following system-generated data files:
assignment__actions; interview__actions; interview__comments; interview__diagnostics; interview__errors. The above data files are saved in the same data format as the main survey data, for example, if the main data is requested in Stata format, the system-generated data files will also be exported in Stata format.
The data files are also accompanied by an automatically generated text file named export__readme.</p><span class="data d-block">October 1, 2019</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/headquarters/export/paradata_file_format/>Paradata file format</a></h3><p>Every survey collected in Survey Solutions is supplemented with a paradata file. No actions are needed from the questionnaire designers or headquarters team to collect it, it is produced automatically by the Survey Solutions software.
The paradata files describe the process of data collection. They explain how the data was entered, detailing all edits, who and when undertaken them. These files may be large and most conveniently processed using specialized statistical packages, rather than general purpose tools.</p><span class="data d-block">June 5, 2019</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/headquarters/export/export-to-cloud-storage/>Export to cloud storage</a></h3><p>Binary data files, such as pictures and audio recordings are often large and can be time-consuming to download. One can now opt for pushing the data to own cloud storage, rather than downloading directly. The following cloud storage repositories are supported:
DropBox; Google Drive; OneDrive. The direct download of binary data in the form of a single large zip-archive remains available. To push the data to the cloud storage, select the corresponding option in the download dialog, then authenticate yourself with the corresponding cloud storage provider:</p><span class="data d-block">June 5, 2019</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/headquarters/export/merging-files/>Merging files of different data levels</a></h3><p>Survey Solutions produces export data files separately for each data level. This can be for example households, persons, plots, crops, etc. The process is completely automatic and not configurable by the user.
If you need to combine information from different data levels (for example bring household characteristics to the personal level) you can utilize a statistical package to post-process your data. This is a basic operation supported by most packages, such as SAS, SPSS, Stata, R and others, though the exact terms may differ by package.</p><span class="data d-block">January 7, 2019</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/headquarters/export/export_of_calculated_variables/>Export of calculated variables</a></h3><p>Calculated variables are commonly used in CAPI questionnaires to implement complex checks or indicate to the interviewer some derived information. For example, one may create a variable that calculates the number of children in the household,
numChildren = Persons.Count(person => person.age &lt; 18)
and use this variable in subsequent questions to check if the number of children in a household exceeds a specific threshold.
Starting with version 5.24 of Survey Solutions these variables will be automatically included in the export data.</p><span class="data d-block">September 28, 2018</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/headquarters/export/missing-values/>Missing values</a></h3><p>Survey Solutions recognizes two situations of missingness:
the value is missing because the logic of the questionnaire is disabling (skipping) this question. There is nothing that the interviewer can do to enter a value in such a field and in some cases even to see the question and its options. the value is missing despite the question is enabled (not skipped). This could be because of any of the following: interviewer hasn&rsquo;t reached this point in the interview; interviewer missed the question, didn&rsquo;t ask it and hence no answer was recorded; none of the options was suitable to accommodate the respondent&rsquo;s answer and hence the interviewer didn&rsquo;t record the answer; other similar situations.</p><span class="data d-block">June 13, 2017</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/headquarters/export/stata-export-file-format/>Stata export file format</a></h3><p>When Survey Solutions v5.18 is writing an exported data file in Stata format it is producing it according to Stata 14 data file specification, available from StataCorp LLC. Stata versions prior to version 14.0 (e.g. 12.0, 13.1, etc) cannot open these files because these older versions of the software are not aware of the newer file format.
