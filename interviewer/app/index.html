An interviewer switches to this view by pressing the map icon located in the toolbar next to the synchronization icon on the main dashboard.
Several maps are offered for the Interviewer application (three online maps) and (1 offline map), and more offline maps can be uploaded by the headquarters users using the same procedure as the maps are assigned to be used in the geography-type question.</p><span class="data d-block">July 20, 2020</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/interviewer/app/app-notifications/>Interviewer App Notifications</a></h3><p>The Interviewer App reminds the interviewers about recommended actions when certain conditions are met by issuing user notifications. It is expected that if the interviewers follow the notifications issued by the software their work will be more efficient, and will let other team members (e.g. supervisors) to act sooner on the collected data.
Some notifications are shown inside the Interviewer app (at the dashboard) and some are shown in the Android system notifications tray.</p><span class="data d-block">June 3, 2019</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/interviewer/app/password-best-practices/>Password Best Practices</a></h3><p>All users:
Do not write your password on a sticker attached to your device or in another obvious place. Do not let any other person know your password. Do not rely on another person to communicate the password to you unless this is an established procedure (in other words it is normal that the headquarters users set a password for the interviewers, but it must be communicated directly to the interviewer, not through another interviewer).</p><span class="data d-block">April 5, 2019</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/interviewer/app/password-reset/>Interviewer Password Reset</a></h3><p>This article describes the actions of the supervisor in case the interviewer forgets the password that was assigned to him.
Survey Solutions doesn&rsquo;t store the passwords of interviewers in the clear text. So if it is forgotten, no user may look it up inside Survey Solutions, neither the Supervisors, nor the Headquarters, nor the Administrator users.
Important: The interviewer may not change his own password himself. This requires cooperation of his supervisor or a headquarters user.</p><span class="data d-block">April 5, 2019</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/interviewer/app/interviewer-dashboard-managing-the-workload/>Interviewer Dashboard: Managing the Workload</a></h3><p>Overview of the Interviewer Dashboard The Interviewer dashboard offers an overview of the interviewer’s assignments and the state of completion they are in. The tabs displayed at the top of the dashboard sorts interviews by their status.
Navigation between tabs To navigate between the different tabs, the interviewer can either tap on the tab at the top bar or swipe left or right. To help interviewers differentiate between the different tabs, the color of the dashboard will change based on which tab the interviewer is currently in.</p><span class="data d-block">July 5, 2017</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/interviewer/app/synchronization/>Synchronization</a></h3><p>Sending completed interviews and receiving new ones The synchronization button is how the interviewer initiates an information exchange between their tablet and their supervisor’s laptop. Synchronization performs two tasks. First, it automatically pushes any completed assignment to the supervisor for review. Second, it automatically pulls all new assignments and data collection instruments onto the interviewer’s tablet. After synchronization is complete, the number of new assignments received, number of completed interviews sent, and so on are clearly displayed.</p><span class="data d-block">July 15, 2016</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/interviewer/app/quality-control-marking-interviews-as-complete-/>Quality Control & Marking Interviews as Complete</a></h3><p>Checking whether all questions have been answered Quality control starts with the interviewer. The interviewer should thus do everything within their power to ensure that all questions are answered.
The interviewer application offers three ways to do this. The first is the classic method that one might use with a paper questionnaire. The interviewer simply flips the questionnaire looking for unanswered questions or answers that have triggered red error messages.</p><span class="data d-block">July 14, 2016</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/interviewer/app/moving-around-the-questionnaire-/>Moving Around the Questionnaire</a></h3><p>Overall Interviewers should strictly follow the survey protocol for administering a questionnaire (e.g. asking earlier questions before later questions, completing earlier modules before later modules), but may occasionally need to move around the questionnaire for good reasons (e.g. review their work, move between rows of the roster if the respondent corrects an earlier answer, administer an independent module when the key respondent for that module is present).
The interviewer can move around questionnaires in several ways.</p><span class="data d-block">July 14, 2016</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/interviewer/app/comments/>Comments</a></h3><p>Comments can be left for any question. This may useful to explain answers that you have confirmed but that may appear strange or wrong to your supervisor.
To leave a comment, press for a moment on the question of interest. After a few seconds, a comment field will appear, into which you can type any arbitrary long comment.
Comments can also be left for you by your supervisor. These will likely be questions about the answers you have recorded.</p><span class="data d-block">July 14, 2016</span></div><div class="article-short-view pl-5 position-relative"><h3><a href=/interviewer/app/answering-all-question-types/>Answering All Question Types</a></h3><p>The Interviewer application allows several different types of questions: numeric, text, single-select categorical, multi-select categorical, list, date, GPS, barcode, and picture. As an interviewer, you must know how to answer each of them. To help you with that text, each question type is briefly explained below with visual aids.
 Numeric Questions that take a numeric response have a field for an open numeric answer. When that field is tapped, the numeric keyboard appears so that the interviewer can compose an appropriate numerical response.</p><span class="data d-block">July 14, 2016</span></div><nav aria-label=... class=mb-3><ul class="pagination justify-content-center"><li class="page-item disabled"><a class=page-link href=# tabindex=-1>Previous</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=/interviewer/app/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/interviewer/app/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/interviewer/app/page/2/>Next</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer pt-3 pb-1 px-sm-3 px-lg-0"><div class="container copyright"><div class=float-left>&#169; 2016-2021 The World Bank Group.<br>All rights Reserved. <a href=https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/legal _target=blank>Legal</a><br><a class=text-primary href=/about/ _target=blank><b class=text-primary>About the team</b></a>
