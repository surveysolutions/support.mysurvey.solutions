Similarly to the Interviewer App on the tablet, the web interviewer allows interviewers to view their dashboard and conduct interviews. There are, however, some differences between the web interviewer and the Interviewer App:
Interviewer App
Web Interviewer
Devices
Android-based tablets
Any devices with a web-browser
Access to internet

Logging in to the server is usually not required in face-to-face CAPI surveys conducted with tablets. After successfully logging in, the interviewer can review his/her interviewer profile:

An interview may be started with the web interviewer, and then continued on the tablet after the interviewer initializes and synchronizes it.
